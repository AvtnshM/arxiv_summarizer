cs.LG,Agent-Omni: Test-Time Multimodal Reasoning via Model Coordination for   Understanding Anything,"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but remain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with large aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image, audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while maintaining transparency and interpretability.

**Introducing Agent-Omni: A Breakthrough in Multimodal Reasoning**

Imagine having a conversational AI that can understand and respond to a wide range of inputs, including text, images, audio, and video. Current AI models are limited to specific types of data and require extensive training to work with multiple formats. Researchers have now developed a new framework called Agent-Omni, which enables flexible and robust multimodal reasoning without requiring costly retraining.

**How it works**

Agent-Omni uses a master-agent system that coordinates existing AI models, or ""agents,"" to work together to understand and respond to user queries. The master agent interprets the user's intent, delegates tasks to specialized agents, and integrates their outputs into a coherent response. This approach allows Agent-Omni to seamlessly integrate with a wide range of AI models, making it adaptable to diverse inputs and transparent in its decision-making process.

**Key benefits**

The Agent-Omni framework has several key benefits:

* **Flexibility**: It can work with various types of data, including text, images, audio, and video.
* **State-of-the-art performance**: Agent-Omni achieves top-notch performance on a range of tasks, particularly those requiring complex cross-modal reasoning.
* **Modularity**: The framework is easily extensible, allowing researchers to integrate new AI models and improve its capabilities over time.

**The future of AI**

The development of Agent-Omni marks an important step towards creating more versatile and intelligent AI systems. Its modular design and adaptability make it an attractive solution for a wide range of applications, from chatbots and virtual assistants to more complex tasks like multimedia analysis and decision-making."
cs.LG,In Good GRACEs: Principled Teacher Selection for Knowledge Distillation,"Knowledge distillation is an efficient strategy to use data generated by large ""teacher"" language models to train smaller capable ""student"" models, but selecting the optimal teacher for a specific student-task combination requires expensive trial-and-error. We propose a lightweight score called GRACE to quantify how effective a teacher will be for post-training a student model. GRACE measures distributional properties of the student's gradients without access to a verifier, teacher logits, teacher internals, or test data. From an information-theoretic perspective, GRACE connects to leave-one-out stability of gradient-based algorithms, which controls the generalization performance of the distilled students. On GSM8K and MATH, GRACE correlates strongly (up to 86% Spearman correlation) with the performance of the distilled LLaMA and OLMo students. In particular, training a student using the GRACE-selected teacher can improve the performance by up to 7.4% over naively using the best-performing teacher. Further, GRACE can provide guidance on crucial design choices in distillation, including (1) the best temperature to use when generating from the teacher, (2) the best teacher to use given a size constraint, and (3) the best teacher to use within a specific model family. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that GRACE can efficiently and effectively identify a strongly compatible teacher for a given student and provide fine-grained guidance on how to perform distillation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02833v1,2025-11-04T18:58:47Z,"Abhishek Panigrahi, Bingbin Liu, Sadhika Malladi, Sham Kakade, Surbhi Goel","Here's a summary of the research paper for a general audience:

**Efficiently Training AI Models with ""Teacher"" Help**

Imagine trying to train a small AI model to perform a specific task, but instead of starting from scratch, you could leverage the knowledge of a much larger, more powerful AI model. This technique is called ""knowledge distillation."" However, finding the best larger model (or ""teacher"") to help train the smaller model (or ""student"") can be a time-consuming and costly process.

Researchers have developed a new method called GRACE, which helps identify the most effective teacher for a given student model and task. GRACE uses a simple score to predict how well a teacher will help a student model learn, without needing to test the teacher or student on actual data.

In tests, GRACE was able to accurately predict which teachers would help student models perform best, with a strong correlation of up to 86%. By using GRACE to select the best teacher, researchers were able to improve student model performance by up to 7.4% compared to using a randomly selected teacher.

GRACE also provides guidance on other important aspects of knowledge distillation, such as how to generate data from the teacher and which teacher to choose given certain constraints. Overall, GRACE offers a efficient and effective way to identify the best teacher for a given student model, making it easier to train high-performing AI models."

cs.LG,GeoCrossBench: Cross-Band Generalization for Remote Sensing,"The number and diversity of remote sensing satellites grows over time, while the vast majority of labeled data comes from older satellites. As the foundation models for Earth observation scale up, the cost of (re-)training to support new satellites grows too, so the generalization capabilities of the models towards new satellites become increasingly important. In this work we introduce GeoCrossBench, an extension of the popular GeoBench benchmark with a new evaluation protocol: it tests the in-distribution performance; generalization to satellites with no band overlap; and generalization to satellites with additional bands with respect to the training set. We also develop a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, ChiViT, to improve its cross-satellite performance. First, we show that even the best foundation models for remote sensing (DOFA, TerraFM) do not outperform general purpose models like DINOv3 in the in-distribution setting. Second, when generalizing to new satellites with no band overlap, all models suffer 2-4x drop in performance, and ChiViT significantly outperforms the runner-up DINOv3. Third, the performance of all tested models drops on average by 5-25\% when given additional bands during test time. Finally, we show that fine-tuning just the last linear layer of these models using oracle labels from all bands can get relatively consistent performance across all satellites, highlighting that the benchmark is far from being saturated.

cs.LG,Accelerated Frank-Wolfe Algorithms: Complementarity Conditions and   Sparsity,"We develop new accelerated first-order algorithms in the Frank-Wolfe (FW) family for minimizing smooth convex functions over compact convex sets, with a focus on two prominent constraint classes: (1) polytopes and (2) matrix domains given by the spectrahedron and the unit nuclear-norm ball. A key technical ingredient is a complementarity condition that captures solution sparsity -- face dimension for polytopes and rank for matrices. We present two algorithms: (1) a purely linear optimization oracle (LOO) method for polytopes that has optimal worst-case first-order (FO) oracle complexity and, aside of a finite \emph{burn-in} phase and up to a logarithmic factor, has LOO complexity that scales with $r/\sqrt{\epsilon}$, where $\epsilon$ is the target accuracy and $r$ is the solution sparsity $r$ (independently of the ambient dimension), and (2) a hybrid scheme that combines FW with a sparse projection oracle (e.g., low-rank SVDs for matrix domains with low-rank solutions), which also has optimal FO oracle complexity, and after a finite burn-in phase, only requires $O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ sparse projections and LOO calls (independently of both the ambient dimension and the rank of optimal solutions).

The key innovation is a ""complementarity condition"" that helps identify the sparse structure of the solution. Sparsity refers to the idea that many solutions to these optimization problems have a simple, compact representation.

The first algorithm is particularly efficient for problems with polytope constraints, which are common in machine learning and statistics. It achieves optimal performance guarantees and requires a number of operations that scales with the solution's sparsity, rather than the problem's overall size.

The second algorithm is a hybrid method that combines the strengths of different optimization techniques. It achieves similar performance guarantees and requires a significantly reduced number of operations, especially for problems with matrix constraints. This is particularly important for applications involving large datasets and high-dimensional matrices.

Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN and TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning.

They also explored how well the models' predictions correlated with the actual strength of a team's win, measured by the difference in score.

The study found that most machine learning models were able to accurately predict win strength, meaning that teams with higher predicted win probabilities tended to win by larger margins. The researchers then used these predictions to inform betting strategies on run-line bets, a type of bet where the goal is to predict the margin of victory.

While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that subtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the errors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs frequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing analyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative, yet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further test well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to see if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while few-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve near-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these findings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and recoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02795v1,2025-11-04T18:20:17Z,"Mayank Jobanputra, Nils Philipp Walter, Maitrey Mehta, Blerta Veseli, Evan Parker Kelly Chapple, Yifan Wang, Sneha Chetani, Ellie Pavlick, Antonio Vergari, Vera Demberg","**Can Large Language Models Subtract Numbers?**

The study tested eight LLMs on addition and subtraction problems and found that while they were good at addition, they were much less accurate at subtraction. When the result of a subtraction problem was negative (e.g., 2 - 5 = -3), the LLMs often got the magnitude right (e.g., 3) but forgot to include the negative sign.

The researchers also tried to improve the LLMs' performance using techniques like few-shot learning (providing a few examples to learn from) and instruction-tuning (fine-tuning the model on specific tasks). They found that these techniques helped, especially instruction-tuning, which enabled the models to generate negative signs correctly.

cs.LG,Enhancing Federated Learning Privacy with QUBO,"Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning (ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without centralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing sensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a client's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can launch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client participated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a client's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs), thereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing inputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client exposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates most relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat vectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii) adversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted central server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes that the server has access to a validation/test set with global data distribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds showed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with 147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in general the full-aggregation accuracy or even better.

cs.LG,Adam Reduces a Unique Form of Sharpness: Theoretical Insights Near the   Minimizer Manifold,"Despite the popularity of the Adam optimizer in practice, most theoretical analyses study Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as a proxy for Adam, and little is known about how the solutions found by Adam differ. In this paper, we show that Adam implicitly reduces a unique form of sharpness measure shaped by its adaptive updates, leading to qualitatively different solutions from SGD. More specifically, when the training loss is small, Adam wanders around the manifold of minimizers and takes semi-gradients to minimize this sharpness measure in an adaptive manner, a behavior we rigorously characterize through a continuous-time approximation using stochastic differential equations. We further demonstrate how this behavior differs from that of SGD in a well-studied setting: when training overparameterized models with label noise, SGD has been shown to minimize the trace of the Hessian matrix, $\tr(\mH)$, whereas we prove that Adam minimizes $\tr(\Diag(\mH)^{1/2})$ instead. In solving sparse linear regression with diagonal linear networks, this distinction enables Adam to achieve better sparsity and generalization than SGD. Finally, our analysis framework extends beyond Adam to a broad class of adaptive gradient methods, including RMSProp, Adam-mini, Adalayer and Shampoo, and provides a unified perspective on how these adaptive optimizers reduce sharpness, which we hope will offer insights for future optimizer design.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02773v1,2025-11-04T17:58:57Z,"Xinghan Li, Haodong Wen, Kaifeng Lyu","**Unlocking the Secrets of Adam Optimizer: A New Perspective on Machine Learning**

Machine learning models are trained using optimization algorithms that help them learn from data. Two popular algorithms are Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam. While SGD is often used in theoretical studies, Adam is widely used in practice. Researchers have wondered how the solutions found by Adam differ from those found by SGD. A new study provides insights into how Adam works and how it differs from SGD.

The study shows that Adam reduces a unique form of ""sharpness"" in the solutions it finds. Sharpness refers to how sensitive a solution is to small changes in the data. Adam's adaptive updates allow it to explore the solution space in a way that SGD does not. When the training loss is small, Adam ""wanders"" around the optimal solution and takes steps to minimize this sharpness measure.

The study also compares Adam and SGD in a specific scenario: training overparameterized models with noisy labels. It finds that SGD minimizes the trace of the Hessian matrix, while Adam minimizes a different measure, $\tr(\Diag(\mH)^{1/2})$. This difference leads to better sparsity and generalization performance for Adam in certain problems.

The researchers' analysis framework extends beyond Adam to other adaptive gradient methods, including RMSProp and Shampoo. Their work provides a unified perspective on how these optimizers reduce sharpness, which can inform the design of future optimization algorithms.

**In simple terms:** Adam, a popular optimization algorithm, works differently than SGD, a commonly studied algorithm. Adam's adaptive approach helps it find solutions that are less sensitive to small changes in the data, leading to better performance in certain situations. This study sheds light on the strengths of Adam and provides a new perspective on optimization in machine learning."

Our contributions are: (i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on SELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable formulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with low-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation with limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks, our approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal smooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional exploration and property-aware generation. On the Tartarus benchmarks, the conditional model shifts docking-score distributions toward stronger predicted binding.

cs.LG,VecComp: Vector Computing via MIMO Digital Over-the-Air Computation,"Recently, the ChannelComp framework has proposed digital over-the-air computation by designing digital modulations that enable the computation of arbitrary functions. Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which is restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of computational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication systems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local information processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp is currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous data-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is susceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of the ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with multiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector function computation but also ensures scalability in the computational complexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such, VecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel impairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric applications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared error of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel conditions. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of VecComp in improving the computation of vector functions and fading compensation over noisy and fading multiple-access channels.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02765v1,2025-11-04T17:46:11Z,"Saeed Razavikia, José Mairton Barros Da Silva Junior, Carlo Fischione","**Breakthrough in Wireless Computing: VecComp Enables Efficient Vector Computing Over-the-Air**

VecComp builds upon a previous framework called ChannelComp, which allowed for digital computation of functions over wireless channels. However, ChannelComp had limitations, only supporting simple (scalar) computations and being vulnerable to signal degradation due to channel fading. VecComp overcomes these limitations by integrating ChannelComp with multiple-antenna technology.

The result is a system that can efficiently compute complex vector functions, which are crucial in many data-driven applications. VecComp's key advantages include:

* **Scalability**: VecComp can handle high-dimensional data and performs computations with increasing efficiency as the data size grows.
* **Robustness**: VecComp is resilient to channel impairments, such as fading and noise, ensuring reliable computation over wireless channels.

The researchers behind VecComp have established a mathematical upper bound on the system's error rate, confirming its computation efficiency under realistic channel conditions. Numerical experiments have also demonstrated VecComp's effectiveness in computing vector functions and mitigating the effects of fading.

cs.LG,From Solo to Symphony: Orchestrating Multi-Agent Collaboration with   Single-Agent Demos,"Training a team of agents from scratch in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is highly inefficient, much like asking beginners to play a symphony together without first practicing solo. Existing methods, such as offline or transferable MARL, can ease this burden, but they still rely on costly multi-agent data, which often becomes the bottleneck. In contrast, solo experiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g., collaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock their potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that transfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a shared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation during multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an MoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse cooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency and performance of backbone algorithms.

However, it converges slowly due to the inherent curse of dimensionality when searching for descent directions in the high-dimensional parameter space of billion-scale LLMs. We propose ConMeZO, a novel zeroth-order optimizer that accelerates convergence by adaptive directional sampling. Instead of drawing the direction uniformly at random, ConMeZO restricts the sampling to a cone centered around a momentum estimate. This concentrates the search in directions where the true gradient is more likely to lie and thus reduces the effect of high dimensions. We prove that ConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO. Empirically, when finetuning LLMs on natural language tasks, ConMeZO is up to 2X faster than MeZO while retaining the low-memory footprint of zeroth-order methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02757v1,2025-11-04T17:35:52Z,"Lejs Deen Behric, Liang Zhang, Bingcong Li, Kiran Koshy Thekumparampil","Here's a summary of the research paper for a general audience:

**Improving the Efficiency of Fine-Tuning Large Language Models**

Large language models, like those used in chatbots and language translation tools, are incredibly powerful but also require a lot of computational resources to fine-tune for specific tasks. One way to fine-tune these models is to use a method called ""zeroth-order optimization,"" which doesn't require storing a lot of information about the model's internal workings. However, this method can be slow, especially for very large models.

Researchers have proposed a new method called ConMeZO, which improves the efficiency of zeroth-order optimization. ConMeZO works by focusing the search for the best model parameters on a specific region of the vast space of possible parameters, rather than searching randomly. This approach allows ConMeZO to converge faster than existing methods, making it up to 2 times faster while still using a low-memory footprint.

In simple terms, ConMeZO is a more efficient way to fine-tune large language models, which could lead to faster and more accurate language processing tools. This research has the potential to make a significant impact on the development of more efficient and effective language models."

The method, called a ""distributed and scalable approach,"" allows researchers to identify patterns and relationships in data from different sources, such as electronic health records (EHRs), without sharing sensitive information.

**The Problem: Analyzing Complex Medical Data**

Traditional methods for analyzing medical data face significant challenges. Modern data environments are characterized by **high dimensionality**, meaning there are many variables to consider; **source heterogeneity**, meaning data comes from different sources; and **stringent data-sharing constraints**, meaning that sensitive information must be protected. These challenges make it difficult to analyze large amounts of data and identify meaningful patterns.

The DANIEL approach addresses these challenges by using a technique called the Ising model, a type of mathematical model that helps identify relationships between different variables. By optimizing a special type of mathematical function, DANIEL can efficiently analyze large datasets and identify patterns that may not be apparent through other methods.

**Key Benefits**

The DANIEL approach has several key benefits:

* **Scalability**: DANIEL can handle large amounts of data from multiple sources.
* **Privacy preservation**: DANIEL maintains patient privacy by not sharing sensitive information.
* **Improved performance**: DANIEL outperforms traditional methods in identifying relationships and patterns in patient data.

* **Detect relationships** between different medical conditions and patient characteristics
* **Identify patient phenotypes** (groups of patients with similar characteristics)
* **Cluster patients** with similar needs and outcomes

**Implications and Future Directions**

The development of DANIEL has significant implications for the analysis of complex medical data. By enabling the analysis of large amounts of data while maintaining patient privacy, DANIEL can help researchers and clinicians better understand patient needs and develop more effective treatments. Future studies will focus on applying DANIEL to other types of medical data and exploring its potential applications in different fields."

We reframe open radio access network (O-RAN) near-real-time (Near-RT) control via counterfactual dynamics and a world modeling (WM) paradigm that learns an action-conditioned generative state space. This enables quantitative ""what-if"" forecasting beyond large language models (LLMs) as the primary modeling primitive. Actions such as physical resource blocks (PRBs) are treated as first-class control inputs in a causal world model, and both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty are modeled for prediction and what-if analysis.

The model couples multi-scale structured state-space mixtures (MS3M) with a compact stochastic latent to form WM-MS3M, summarizing key performance indicators (KPIs) histories and predicting next-step KPIs under hypothetical PRB sequences. On realistic O-RAN traces, WM-MS3M cuts mean absolute error (MAE) by 1.69% versus MS3M with 32% fewer parameters and similar latency, and achieves 35-80% lower root mean squared error (RMSE) than attention/hybrid baselines with 2.3-4.1x faster inference, enabling rare-event simulation and offline policy screening.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02748v1,2025-11-04T17:22:22Z,"Farhad Rezazadeh, Hatim Chergui, Merouane Debbah, Houbing Song, Dusit Niyato, Lingjia Liu","**Imagine a Smarter Future: A New Approach to 6G Technology**

However, to our knowledge, no study to date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually helps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we perform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on interpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a non-interpretable model. Second, we repeat the study but ask $N=12$ human teachers to make the teaching decisions based on the information provided by KT models. As expected, teachers rate interpretable KT models higher in terms of usability and trustworthiness. However, the number of tasks needed until mastery hardly differs between KT models. This suggests that the relationship between model interpretability and teacher decisions is not straightforward: teachers do not solely rely on KT models to make decisions and further research is needed to investigate how learners and teachers actually understand and use KT models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02718v1,2025-11-04T16:40:24Z,"Adia Khalid, Alina Deriyeva, Benjamin Paassen","**Can Teachers Make Better Decisions with More Transparent Learning Models?**

To address these challenges, researchers have developed a unified benchmarking framework to systematically evaluate the performance of AI-generated image detection methods. This framework uses controlled and reproducible conditions to test the effectiveness of various detection methods.

**Key Findings**

The study evaluated ten state-of-the-art detection methods and seven publicly available datasets. The results showed significant variability in the performance of these methods, with some exhibiting strong performance in certain situations but struggling with others. The study also found that some methods were not very transparent or interpretable, making it difficult to understand why they made certain predictions.

**Implications and Future Directions**

The study aims to guide the research community towards developing more robust, generalizable, and explainable solutions for detecting AI-generated images. The findings highlight the need for:

1. **Standardized benchmarks**: Using standardized datasets and evaluation metrics to compare the effectiveness of detection methods.
2. **Improved evaluation metrics**: Developing metrics that capture generalization and explainability.
3. **More robust methods**: Developing detection methods that can perform well in a variety of situations.

By addressing these challenges, researchers can develop more effective solutions for detecting AI-generated fake images and mitigating their potential harm."
cs.CV,"When Visualizing is the First Step to Reasoning: MIRA, a Benchmark for   Visual Chain-of-Thought","We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios where generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful reasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in MIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as sketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning process. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through ""drawing to think"". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically challenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning steps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our evaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems, annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a unified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation input: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with image and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image clues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity on our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under different k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large language models, including strongest private models as well as strong open-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts. However, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves consistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and tasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited improvements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the critical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning on MIRA.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02779v1,2025-11-04T18:00:51Z,"Yiyang Zhou, Haoqin Tu, Zijun Wang, Zeyu Wang, Niklas Muennighoff, Fan Nie, Yejin Choi, James Zou, Chaorui Deng, Shen Yan, Haoqi Fan, Cihang Xie, Huaxiu Yao, Qinghao Ye","**Unlocking the Power of Visual Thinking: A New Benchmark for AI Reasoning**

Imagine trying to solve a complex puzzle or understand a intricate system. Humans often use visual aids like sketches or diagrams to help guide their thinking. Researchers have created a new benchmark, called MIRA, to test whether AI models can do the same.

MIRA is a set of 546 challenging problems that require AI models to generate and use intermediate visual images to reason and arrive at a solution. These problems involve complex structures, spatial relationships, and reasoning steps that are hard to express with language alone.

The results show that current AI models struggle with these problems when only given textual prompts. However, when provided with visual cues, such as annotated images, their performance improves significantly - by an average of 33.7%. This highlights the importance of visual thinking in enabling successful reasoning.

The researchers also explored the limitations of current AI models and found that even with expanded search spaces and carefully designed textual prompts, they couldn't match the performance achieved with visual cues. This suggests that AI models need to be able to generate and utilize visual information to truly reason and solve complex problems.

The MIRA benchmark provides a new way to evaluate AI models and pushes the boundaries of what we expect from AI systems. By incorporating visual thinking, AI models can become more powerful and human-like in their problem-solving abilities."
cs.CV,VCode: a Multimodal Coding Benchmark with SVG as Symbolic Visual   Representation,"Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically, frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i) Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual representation.

**The Future of Coding: A New Way to Represent Visual Information**

Imagine being able to describe a picture using code, just like a computer program. Researchers have made progress in using code to solve problems, but most of this work focuses on language-based tasks, like writing text. Now, a team of researchers has introduced a new benchmark called VCode, which explores the use of code to represent visual information, like images.

**The Challenge: Turning Images into Code**

The goal of VCode is to take an image and generate code that accurately represents what's in the image. This code is written in a format called SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), which is like a set of instructions that a computer can understand. The researchers want to see if computers can generate code that not only looks like the image but also preserves the meaning and symbols in the image.

**The Benchmark: Testing Computers' Abilities**

VCode includes three different areas to test: everyday knowledge, professional skills, and visual perception. The researchers also created a new way to evaluate how well computers generate code, called CodeVQA. They found that even the best computers struggle to generate accurate code, showing a gap between language-based and visual-based coding.

**A New Solution: VCoder**

To bridge this gap, the researchers developed a new framework called VCoder. VCoder helps computers generate better code by using a process called ""thinking with revision,"" which refines the code over time. It also uses ""acting with visual tools,"" which provides structured information about the image, like objects and shapes.

**The Results: A Significant Improvement**

The researchers found that VCoder significantly improves the accuracy of generated code, outperforming the best computers by 12.3 points. They also showed that humans and computers perform better when working with code that accurately represents visual information.

**What's Next?**

The researchers have made their benchmark and code available online, which will help advance the field of visual-centric coding. This work has the potential to enable computers to better understand and generate visual information, leading to new applications in areas like computer vision, robotics, and more."
cs.CV,PercHead: Perceptual Head Model for Single-Image 3D Head Reconstruction   & Editing,"We present PercHead, a method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and semantic 3D editing - two tasks that are inherently challenging due to severe view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and the ambiguity of editing in 3D space. We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D heads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder followed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through iterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At the heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on DINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric and appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to extreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this base model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the encoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry and style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control geometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance. We highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model through a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt geometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural language or image prompts.

cs.CV,Dynamic Reflections: Probing Video Representations with Text Alignment,"The alignment of representations from different modalities has recently been shown to provide insights on the structural similarities and downstream capabilities of different encoders across diverse data types. While significant progress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of video data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing the capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal several key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly depends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos) and text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time, especially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric test-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable predictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the correlation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and non-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment against text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and understanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal alignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models. Overall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot way to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal data.

The study found that the alignment of video and text representations depends on the richness of both the visual and text data provided. For example, a video with multiple frames and a detailed text caption can lead to better alignment than a single image with a short caption. The researchers also discovered that strong alignment between video and text encoders may be linked to better performance on a range of tasks, from understanding video content to answering questions.

The study also explored the connection between temporal reasoning (understanding the sequence of events) and cross-modal alignment (how well video and text representations match). The findings suggest that video-text alignment can be a useful tool for evaluating the representation power of different models for spatio-temporal data, such as videos.

cs.CV,LLEXICORP: End-user Explainability of Convolutional Neural Networks,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision systems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to explain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works suggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be attributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance propagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find images that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are largely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered concepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting the accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.   To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept Relevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a multimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that translate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To ensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the semantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and explanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences, offering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries for non-technical stakeholders.   We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a VGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to interpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02720v1,2025-11-04T16:44:45Z,"Vojtěch Kůr, Adam Bajger, Adam Kukučka, Marek Hradil, Vít Musil, Tomáš Brázdil","**Making AI More Transparent: A New Approach to Understanding Neural Networks**

The study focuses on a type of AI called convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are used in many computer vision systems. While CNNs are powerful, they can be difficult to understand, making it challenging to trust their decisions. To address this issue, researchers developed a new method called LLEXICORP.

LLEXICORP uses a large language model to automatically explain how a CNN makes its decisions. The method works by identifying the key features that the CNN uses to classify images, and then generating natural-language explanations that describe these features. For example, if a CNN is used to diagnose medical images, LLEXICORP might explain that the AI is looking for certain patterns or features in the images to make its diagnosis.

The researchers tested LLEXICORP on a well-known CNN model and found that it can significantly improve our understanding of how the AI works. The method can generate explanations that are tailored to different audiences, from technical experts to non-technical stakeholders.

Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of LLEXICORP to make AI more transparent and trustworthy. By providing insights into how AI systems work, LLEXICORP can help build confidence in AI and facilitate its adoption in critical applications."

Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories, eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks (WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively, surpassing all previous methods.

Imagine being able to track changes in the Earth's surface, such as deforestation, urbanization, or natural disasters, with unprecedented accuracy. Researchers have made a significant step forward in this area with the development of UniChange, a new model that uses a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to unify change detection tasks.

**The Problem: Limited Models and Data**

Current change detection models are limited by their reliance on single-type annotated data, which restricts their ability to generalize and adapt to different types of changes. This means that models trained on one type of data may not perform well on others.

**The Solution: UniChange**

UniChange overcomes this limitation by leveraging the language understanding capabilities of MLLMs to integrate information from diverse datasets. This allows the model to detect both binary changes (e.g., change vs. no change) and semantic changes (e.g., type of change, such as from forest to urban area).

**Key Innovations**

1. **Unified Framework**: UniChange provides a single framework for both binary and semantic change detection tasks.
2. **Special Tokens**: The model uses three special tokens to identify changes and guide the detection process.
3. **Text Prompts**: UniChange uses text prompts to identify change categories, eliminating the need for predefined classification heads.

**Results and Impact**

Experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate that UniChange achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing all previous methods. The model's ability to unify change detection tasks and leverage diverse datasets has significant implications for monitoring and analyzing land cover dynamics.

**Availability**

The code for UniChange is available on GitHub, making it accessible to researchers and practitioners in the field."

cs.CV,TAUE: Training-free Noise Transplant and Cultivation Diffusion Model,"Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique, Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent representations from both foreground and composite generation processes, transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods, enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative workflows.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02580v1,2025-11-04T13:56:39Z,"Daichi Nagai, Ryugo Morita, Shunsuke Kitada, Hitoshi Iyatomi","**Breakthrough in AI Image Generation: TAUE Model Enables Layer-by-Layer Control**

Manual segmentation achieves high accuracy but is labor-intensive and prone to variability, thus prompting the development of automated approaches. Recently, a breadth of foundation models has enabled automated segmentations across diverse anatomies and imaging modalities, but these may not always meet the clinical accuracy standards. While segmentation refinement strategies can improve performance, current methods depend on heavy user interactions or require fully supervised segmentations for training. Here, we present SCORE (Segmentation COrrection from Regional Evaluations), a weakly supervised framework that learns to refine mask predictions only using light feedback during training. Specifically, instead of relying on dense training image annotations, SCORE introduces a novel loss that leverages region-wise quality scores and over/under-segmentation error labels.

Medical image analysis is a crucial task that helps doctors diagnose and treat diseases. One important step in this process is identifying specific anatomical regions, such as organs or bones, in images. While manual identification is accurate, it's time-consuming and can be prone to errors.

To address this challenge, researchers have developed automated approaches using artificial intelligence (AI). However, these AI models may not always meet the high accuracy standards required in medicine.

A new study presents a solution called SCORE, which helps refine AI-generated segmentations of anatomical regions using minimal feedback from human experts.

By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\% accuracy on average yet generates each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast and clinically scalable solution.

In this paper, we argue that logic offers an adequate framework. In particular, we use logic in a neurosymbolic framework to offer a much needed semantics for deep learning, the neural network-based technology of current AI. Deep learning and neurosymbolic AI lack a general set of conditions to ensure that desirable properties are satisfied.

The study found that these models can accurately predict not only which team will win, but also how convincingly they will win (measured by the score differential).

They found that using machine learning models to make betting decisions can lead to positive returns, but only if done strategically. Simply relying on the models' predictions without careful consideration can lead to significant losses.

At each turn, MemSearcher fuses the user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform search actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for solving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize this workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of MemSearcher Agents.

Current AI search agents have two main limitations:

1. **Information overload**: They store entire conversation histories, which can be long and noisy, making it difficult to process and retrieve relevant information.
2. **Information loss**: They only use the current question, discarding essential context and previous interactions.

**How MemSearcher Works**

MemSearcher addresses these limitations by:

1. Maintaining a compact memory of essential information.
2. Combining the current question with the memory to generate answers and perform search actions.
3. Updating the memory to retain only relevant information.

**Optimizing MemSearcher**

To optimize MemSearcher, researchers developed a new reinforcement learning framework called multi-context GRPO. This framework jointly optimizes three key aspects:

1. **Reasoning**: The ability to draw logical conclusions from the information.
2. **Search strategies**: The ability to effectively search for relevant information.
3. **Memory management**: The ability to manage the compact memory.

**Results and Implications**

MemSearcher achieved significant improvements over existing AI models on seven public benchmarks, with:

* 11% improvement on a 3B model (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct)
* 12% improvement on a 7B model (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct)

Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher even outperformed 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance between information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and lower computational overhead.

**The Future of AI Search Agents**

The MemSearcher approach has the potential to improve the performance and efficiency of AI search agents, enabling more effective and scalable conversational AI systems. The code and models used in this research will be publicly available, allowing other researchers to build upon this work."

However, their adoption remains limited due to heterogeneous preprocessing pipelines, fragmented APIs, inconsistent fine-tuning procedures, and the absence of standardized evaluation for deployment-oriented metrics such as calibration and fairness. We present TabTune, a unified library that standardizes the complete workflow for tabular foundation models through a single interface. TabTune provides consistent access to seven state-of-the-art models supporting multiple adaptation strategies, including zero-shot inference, meta-learning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). The framework automates model-aware preprocessing, manages architectural heterogeneity internally, and integrates evaluation modules for performance, calibration, and fairness. Designed for extensibility and reproducibility, TabTune enables consistent benchmarking of adaptation strategies of tabular foundation models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02802v2,2025-11-04T18:25:17Z,"Aditya Tanna, Pratinav Seth, Mohamed Bouadi, Utsav Avaiya, Vinay Kumar Sankarapu","**Unlocking the Power of Tabular Data with TabTune**

Imagine having a single tool that can help you make sense of complex data, like spreadsheets or databases, and make accurate predictions or decisions. That's what TabTune is - a new library that simplifies working with tabular foundation models, a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that's trained on large amounts of data.

Tabular foundation models have shown great promise in analyzing structured data, but their use has been limited due to the complexity of working with them. TabTune changes that by providing a unified interface for accessing seven state-of-the-art models, making it easy to:

1. **Make predictions**: Use pre-trained models to make predictions on new data.
2. **Fine-tune models**: Adjust the models to fit your specific needs.
3. **Evaluate performance**: Assess how well the models are doing, including metrics like accuracy, calibration, and fairness.

TabTune automates many of the tedious tasks involved in working with tabular foundation models, such as data preprocessing and model evaluation. This makes it easier for researchers and practitioners to compare different models and techniques, and to develop new ones.

**What does this mean?**

TabTune has the potential to unlock the full power of tabular data, enabling organizations to make better decisions, improve their operations, and drive innovation. By providing a standardized framework for working with tabular foundation models, TabTune can help to:

* **Improve accuracy**: By making it easier to access and compare different models, TabTune can help organizations choose the best model for their needs.
* **Increase efficiency**: By automating many tasks, TabTune can save time and resources.
* **Promote fairness and transparency**: By providing tools for evaluating model performance, including fairness and calibration, TabTune can help organizations ensure that their models are fair and transparent.

Overall, TabTune is an exciting development that can help to democratize access to AI and unlock the full potential of tabular data."
cs.AI,When One Modality Sabotages the Others: A Diagnostic Lens on Multimodal   Reasoning,"Despite rapid growth in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their reasoning traces remain opaque: it is often unclear which modality drives a prediction, how conflicts are resolved, or when one stream dominates. In this paper, we introduce modality sabotage, a diagnostic failure mode in which a high-confidence unimodal error overrides other evidence and misleads the fused result. To analyze such dynamics, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic evaluation layer that treats each modality as an agent, producing candidate labels and a brief self-assessment used for auditing. A simple fusion mechanism aggregates these outputs, exposing contributors (modalities supporting correct outcomes) and saboteurs (modalities that mislead). Applying our diagnostic layer in a case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with foundation models revealed systematic reliability profiles, providing insight into whether failures may arise from dataset artifacts or model limitations. More broadly, our framework offers a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal reasoning, supporting principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing possible interventions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02794v1,2025-11-04T18:20:13Z,"Chenyu Zhang, Minsol Kim, Shohreh Ghorbani, Jingyao Wu, Rosalind Picard, Patricia Maes, Paul Pu Liang","Here's a summary of the research paper for a general audience:

**The Problem with Multimodal AI Models**

Imagine you're trying to understand a joke that involves both a funny image and a caption. A multimodal AI model would analyze both the image and the caption to understand the joke. However, it's often unclear how the model combines these different types of information (or modalities) to make a decision. For instance, is the model relying more on the image or the caption?

**A New Diagnostic Tool**

Researchers have developed a new tool to help understand how multimodal AI models work. This tool, called a diagnostic layer, treats each type of information (e.g., image, caption) as a separate ""agent"" that provides its own opinion and confidence level. The agents' opinions are then combined to produce a final answer. The diagnostic layer also identifies which agents are contributing to correct answers and which ones are causing errors (or ""sabotaging"" the result).

**What the Researchers Found**

The researchers applied their diagnostic tool to a multimodal AI model that recognizes emotions from images and text. They found that sometimes, one type of information would dominate the others, leading to incorrect answers. For example, if the image is ambiguous but the caption is clear, the model might rely too heavily on the caption and ignore the image. This ""modality sabotage"" can lead to systematic errors, which can arise from either the dataset used to train the model or limitations in the model itself.

**The Impact**

The researchers' diagnostic tool provides a way to audit and understand how multimodal AI models combine different types of information. This can help identify potential errors and inform ways to improve the models. Ultimately, this research aims to make multimodal AI models more reliable and trustworthy."
cs.AI,Measuring AI Diffusion: A Population-Normalized Metric for Tracking   Global AI Usage,"Measuring global AI diffusion remains challenging due to a lack of population-normalized, cross-country usage data. We introduce AI User Share, a novel indicator that estimates the share of each country's working-age population actively using AI tools. Built from anonymized Microsoft telemetry and adjusted for device access and mobile scaling, this metric spans 147 economies and provides consistent, real-time insight into global AI diffusion. We find wide variation in adoption, with a strong correlation between AI User Share and GDP. High uptake is concentrated in developed economies, though usage among internet-connected populations in lower-income countries reveals substantial latent demand. We also detect sharp increases in usage following major product launches, such as DeepSeek in early 2025. While the metric's reliance solely on Microsoft telemetry introduces potential biases related to this user base, it offers an important new lens into how AI is spreading globally. AI User Share enables timely benchmarking that can inform data-driven AI policy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02781v1,2025-11-04T18:03:51Z,"Amit Misra, Jane Wang, Scott McCullers, Kevin White, Juan Lavista Ferres","**Understanding AI Adoption Around the World**

The researchers used anonymized data from Microsoft to calculate AI User Share for 147 countries. They found that AI adoption varies widely, with richer countries leading the way. However, in lower-income countries, many people who have access to the internet are eager to use AI tools.

The study also discovered that AI usage surges when new AI products are launched. For example, after a major AI product called DeepSeek was released in early 2025, usage increased sharply.

While this new metric provides valuable insights into AI adoption, it has some limitations. It only uses data from Microsoft users, which might not represent the entire global population. Nevertheless, AI User Share offers a new perspective on how AI is spreading globally and can help inform policies related to AI.

cs.AI,1 PoCo: Agentic Proof-of-Concept Exploit Generation for Smart Contracts,"Smart contracts operate in a highly adversarial environment, where vulnerabilities can lead to substantial financial losses. Thus, smart contracts are subject to security audits. In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits play a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported vulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually creating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight audit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically generates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability descriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in an agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a Reason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with the Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and other security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world vulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow baselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results demonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort required for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits.

**Title:** 1 PoCo: Automatically Generating Proof-of-Concept Exploits for Smart Contracts

**What it's about:** Smart contracts are digital agreements that execute automatically, but they can be vulnerable to hacking. To prevent this, security experts perform audits to identify potential weaknesses. A crucial part of these audits is creating ""proof-of-concept"" (PoC) exploits, which demonstrate that a vulnerability is real and can be exploited.

**The problem:** Creating PoCs manually is time-consuming, prone to errors, and often rushed due to tight deadlines. This can lead to incomplete or inaccurate PoCs, which can put smart contracts at risk.

**The solution:** Researchers have developed a new framework called POCO, which automatically generates PoC exploits from natural-language descriptions of vulnerabilities. POCO uses a combination of artificial intelligence and code-execution tools to produce fully executable exploits that can be easily integrated into audit reports.

**The results:** POCO was tested on 23 real-world vulnerability reports and outperformed existing methods, generating high-quality PoCs that were well-formed and logically correct. This new framework has the potential to significantly reduce the effort required to create PoCs, making smart contract audits more efficient and effective.

**Why it matters:** By automating the process of generating PoCs, POCO can help prevent financial losses due to smart contract vulnerabilities. This research provides a valuable tool for the smart contract security community, enabling them to identify and address potential weaknesses more effectively."

Meeting the objectives depends on modeling choices, including the probabilistic modeling approach, the conditional generative formulation, the architecture, and the molecular input representation. To address the challenges, we present STAR-VAE (Selfies-encoded, Transformer-based, AutoRegressive Variational Auto Encoder), a scalable latent-variable framework with a Transformer encoder and an autoregressive Transformer decoder. It is trained on 79 million drug-like molecules from PubChem, using SELFIES to guarantee syntactic validity. The latent-variable formulation enables conditional generation: a property predictor supplies a conditioning signal that is applied consistently to the latent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Our contributions are: (i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on SELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable formulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with low-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation with limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks, our approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal smooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional exploration and property-aware generation. On the Tartarus benchmarks, the conditional model shifts docking-score distributions toward stronger predicted binding.

**Making Control Engineering Knowledge More Accessible and Useful**

Control engineering is a field that involves designing and optimizing systems that control machines and processes. With so much new research being published, it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of all the knowledge in the field. This paper proposes a new way to organize and represent control engineering knowledge in a way that's easy for humans to understand and can also be interpreted by computers.

The researchers used a type of artificial intelligence called a language model to help convert natural language descriptions and mathematical equations into a formal, structured format. This format, called a knowledge graph, allows computers to understand the relationships between different concepts and makes it easier to search and retrieve information.

The goal of this work is to create a system that makes control engineering knowledge more accessible, collaborative, and reliable. The researchers envision a future where knowledge bases are easily searchable, verifiable, and can be contributed to by many people. This could lead to faster progress and innovation in the field of control engineering.

**What does this mean for non-experts?**

In simple terms, this research aims to make complex technical information more organized, understandable, and usable. This could have implications for many fields beyond control engineering, such as healthcare, finance, and education, where making complex information more accessible and usable could lead to significant benefits."
cs.AI,AI Diffusion in Low Resource Language Countries,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is diffusing globally at unprecedented speed, but adoption remains uneven. Frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to perform poorly on low-resource languages due to data scarcity. We hypothesize that this performance deficit reduces the utility of AI, thereby slowing adoption in Low-Resource Language Countries (LRLCs). To test this, we use a weighted regression model to isolate the language effect from socioeconomic and demographic factors, finding that LRLCs have a share of AI users that is approximately 20% lower relative to their baseline. These results indicate that linguistic accessibility is a significant, independent barrier to equitable AI diffusion.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02752v1,2025-11-04T17:31:39Z,"Amit Misra, Syed Waqas Zamir, Wassim Hamidouche, Inbal Becker-Reshef, Juan Lavista Ferres","**Artificial Intelligence Adoption Lags in Countries with Limited Language Resources**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly popular worldwide, but its adoption is not uniform across all countries. A recent study found that countries with limited language resources are lagging behind in AI adoption. The main reason for this disparity is that AI systems, specifically large language models, perform poorly on languages with limited data availability.

The study analyzed data from various countries and found that countries with limited language resources have about 20% fewer AI users compared to countries with more abundant language resources. This gap cannot be explained by differences in socioeconomic status or demographics alone.

The findings suggest that linguistic accessibility is a significant barrier to the equitable spread of AI technology. In other words, people who speak languages with limited online presence or resources are less likely to benefit from AI advancements. This highlights the need for more inclusive and diverse AI development that can cater to a broader range of languages and cultures."
cs.AI,Using Span Queries to Optimize for Cache and Attention Locality,"Clients are evolving beyond chat completion, and now include a variety of innovative inference-time scaling and deep reasoning techniques. At the same time, inference servers remain heavily optimized for chat completion. Prior work has shown that large improvements to KV cache hit rate are possible if inference servers evolve towards these non-chat use cases. However, they offer solutions that are also optimized for a single use case, RAG. In this paper, we introduce the span query to generalize the interface to the inference server. We demonstrate that chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads can all be expressed as span queries. We show how the critical distinction that had been assumed by prior work lies in whether the order of the inputs matter -- do they commute? In chat, they do not. In RAG, they often do. This paper introduces span queries, which are expression trees of inference calls, linked together with commutativity constraints. We describe span query syntax and semantics. We show how they can be automatically optimized to improve KV cache locality. We show how a small change to vLLM (affecting only 492 lines) can enable high-performance execution of span queries. Using this stack, we demonstrate that span queries can achieve 10-20x reductions in TTFT for two distinct non-chat use cases. Finally, we show that span queries can also be optimized to improve attention locality, so as to avoid the so-called lost-in-the-middle problem. We demonstrate that an attention-optimized span query on a 2b parameter model vastly outperforms the accuracy of a stock inference server using an 8b model.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02749v1,2025-11-04T17:22:49Z,"Paul Castro, Nick Mitchell, Nathan Ordonez, Thomas Parnell, Mudhakar Srivatsa, Antoni Viros i Martin","**Improving AI Performance with Span Queries**

Artificial intelligence (AI) models are becoming increasingly complex and are being used for a variety of tasks beyond simple chatbots. However, the systems that support these models are still optimized for chatbots, which can lead to inefficiencies. Researchers have proposed a new approach called ""span queries"" to improve the performance of AI models.

**What are Span Queries?**

Span queries are a way to express complex AI tasks as a series of interconnected queries. This allows AI models to be used for a wide range of tasks, including chatbots, reasoning, and decision-making. The key innovation of span queries is that they can be optimized to reduce the amount of data that needs to be retrieved from memory, which can significantly improve performance.

**Benefits of Span Queries**

The researchers demonstrated that span queries can lead to significant improvements in performance, including:

* 10-20x reductions in the time it takes to respond to user queries
* Improved accuracy, even with smaller models

**How it Works**

Span queries work by allowing AI models to be optimized for specific tasks, rather than being limited to a single use case. This is achieved by representing AI tasks as expression trees, which can be linked together with constraints that specify whether the order of inputs matters. By optimizing these expression trees, AI models can be made to run more efficiently and accurately.

**Real-World Impact**

The researchers showed that span queries can be applied to a range of AI tasks, including chatbots, reasoning, and decision-making. They also demonstrated that span queries can be used to improve the accuracy of AI models, even with smaller models.

This neglects a crucial capability: agents' ability to devise and adjust cost-optimal plans in response to changing environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce CostBench, a scalable, cost-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents' economic reasoning and replanning abilities. Situated in the travel-planning domain, CostBench comprises tasks solvable via multiple sequences of atomic and composite tools with diverse, customizable costs. It also supports four types of dynamic blocking events, such as tool failures and cost changes, to simulate real-world unpredictability and necessitate agents to adapt in real time. Evaluating leading open-sourced and proprietary models on CostBench reveals a substantial gap in cost-aware planning: agents frequently fail to identify cost-optimal solutions in static settings, with even GPT-5 achieving less than 75% exact match rate on the hardest tasks, and performance further dropping by around 40% under dynamic conditions. By diagnosing these weaknesses, CostBench lays the groundwork for developing future agents that are both economically rational and robust.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02734v1,2025-11-04T16:58:29Z,"Jiayu Liu, Cheng Qian, Zhaochen Su, Qing Zong, Shijue Huang, Bingxiang He, Yi R.

Current AI agents, like those using Large Language Models (LLMs), are good at completing tasks, but they often don't consider the cost or adapt well to changes.

To address this, researchers have created a new benchmark called CostBench. It's a tool to evaluate AI agents' ability to plan and adapt in a cost-effective way, especially in dynamic environments where things can change unexpectedly. CostBench simulates real-world scenarios, like travel planning, and tests agents' ability to adjust plans in response to changes, such as tool failures or cost changes.

The results show that even top AI models, like GPT-5, struggle to find the most cost-effective solutions, especially in dynamic situations. For example, GPT-5 achieved less than 75% accuracy on the hardest tasks, and its performance dropped by around 40% when faced with dynamic conditions. These findings highlight the need for more research to develop AI agents that can plan, adapt, and make economically rational decisions in a changing world.

cs.AI,LLEXICORP: End-user Explainability of Convolutional Neural Networks,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision systems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to explain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works suggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be attributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance propagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find images that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are largely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered concepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting the accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.   To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept Relevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a multimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that translate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To ensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the semantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and explanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences, offering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries for non-technical stakeholders.

Recently, researchers have developed methods to explain how CNNs make decisions, known as Explainable AI (XAI). One approach, called Concept Relevance Propagation (CRP), tries to identify the key features or concepts that a CNN uses to classify images. However, this process is often manual and time-consuming, requiring experts to interpret and explain the results.

A new method, called LLEXICORP, aims to automate and simplify this process. By combining CRP with a large language model, LLEXICORP can automatically generate natural-language explanations of how a CNN makes decisions. This approach assigns descriptive names to the key concepts and creates intuitive narratives that can be tailored to different audiences.

**Title:** A New Method for Real-Time Estimation of System Inputs and States

**Summary:** Researchers have developed a new method that uses a type of mathematical filter, called an unscented Kalman filter, to estimate the inputs, states, and parameters of a system in real-time. This method is useful for understanding complex systems, such as those found in engineering, physics, and other fields.

**Key Breakthrough:** The method can estimate not only the state of a system (e.g., its current condition) and its parameters (e.g., physical properties), but also the input or force acting on the system. This is a significant improvement over traditional methods that can only estimate some of these factors.

**How it works:** The method uses two stages to make estimates. First, it predicts the system's state and parameters based on past data. Then, it refines these estimates using new measurements. This approach allows for accurate and real-time estimation of the system's inputs, states, and parameters.

**Implications:** This new method has the potential to improve our understanding of complex systems, enabling better monitoring, control, and prediction of their behavior. It can be applied to a wide range of fields, from engineering and physics to finance and environmental science."

Using this framework, we evaluate 32 leading open- and closed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings. Our results reveal a ""collaboration gap"": models that perform well solo often degrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break down dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well alone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting with the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a ""relay inference"" approach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one, closing much of the gap.

The findings have important implications for AI development:

* **Collaboration-aware evaluation**: AI models should be tested on their ability to collaborate, not just their individual performance.
* **Training strategies for collaboration**: AI models should be trained to work effectively with others.
* **Designing interactions that bring out the best in agents**: AI systems should be designed to elicit the strengths of each agent, whether human or AI.

These insights are relevant not only to AI-AI collaboration but also to human-AI collaboration, highlighting the need for a more collaborative approach to AI development."
cs.CL,Agent-Omni: Test-Time Multimodal Reasoning via Model Coordination for   Understanding Anything,"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but remain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with large aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image, audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models become available.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02834v2,2025-11-04T18:59:09Z,"Huawei Lin, Yunzhi Shi, Tong Geng, Weijie Zhao, Wei Wang, Ravender Pal Singh","Here's a summary of the research paper for a general audience:

**Introducing Agent-Omni: A Breakthrough in Multimodal Reasoning**

Imagine being able to ask a computer to explain a joke that includes both text and an image, or to describe a video with accompanying audio commentary. Current artificial intelligence (AI) models can handle some of these tasks, but they're limited to specific combinations of text, images, audio, and video, and require extensive training data.

Researchers have now developed a new framework called Agent-Omni, which enables AI models to reason across multiple modes of communication, such as text, images, audio, and video, without requiring extensive retraining. This framework works by coordinating multiple specialized AI models, each designed to handle a specific type of data, to work together to understand complex inputs.

The Agent-Omni system consists of a ""master agent"" that interprets user requests, assigns tasks to specialized ""agent"" models, and integrates their outputs into a coherent response. This approach allows the system to adapt to diverse inputs, maintain transparency, and be easily extensible as better models become available.

**Key Benefits and Achievements**

* Agent-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks, particularly those requiring complex cross-modal reasoning.
* The framework is modular, flexible, and can seamlessly integrate specialized models, making it easy to improve over time.
* Agent-Omni enables robust reasoning support across text, images, audio, video, and combinations thereof.

Overall, Agent-Omni represents a significant step forward in multimodal reasoning, enabling AI systems to better understand and interpret complex, real-world inputs."
cs.CL,In Good GRACEs: Principled Teacher Selection for Knowledge Distillation,"Knowledge distillation is an efficient strategy to use data generated by large ""teacher"" language models to train smaller capable ""student"" models, but selecting the optimal teacher for a specific student-task combination requires expensive trial-and-error. We propose a lightweight score called GRACE to quantify how effective a teacher will be for post-training a student model. GRACE measures distributional properties of the student's gradients without access to a verifier, teacher logits, teacher internals, or test data. From an information-theoretic perspective, GRACE connects to leave-one-out stability of gradient-based algorithms, which controls the generalization performance of the distilled students. On GSM8K and MATH, GRACE correlates strongly (up to 86% Spearman correlation) with the performance of the distilled LLaMA and OLMo students. In particular, training a student using the GRACE-selected teacher can improve the performance by up to 7.4% over naively using the best-performing teacher. Further, GRACE can provide guidance on crucial design choices in distillation, including (1) the best temperature to use when generating from the teacher, (2) the best teacher to use given a size constraint, and (3) the best teacher to use within a specific model family. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that GRACE can efficiently and effectively identify a strongly compatible teacher for a given student and provide fine-grained guidance on how to perform distillation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02833v1,2025-11-04T18:58:47Z,"Abhishek Panigrahi, Bingbin Liu, Sadhika Malladi, Sham Kakade, Surbhi Goel","Here's a summary of the research paper for a general audience:

**The Problem:** Training small AI models to perform well on complex tasks often requires a lot of data and computational power. One way to overcome this is to use a large, pre-trained ""teacher"" model to guide the training of a smaller ""student"" model. However, finding the best teacher for a specific student and task can be a time-consuming and expensive process.

**The Solution:** Researchers have proposed a new method called GRACE, which helps select the optimal teacher for a given student and task. GRACE is a simple and efficient score that predicts how well a teacher will work with a student model. It does this by analyzing the student's behavior during training, without needing access to additional data or resources.

**The Results:** The researchers tested GRACE on several math problems and found that it can accurately predict which teachers will work best with a given student model. In fact, using GRACE to select a teacher improved the student's performance by up to 7.4% compared to randomly selecting a teacher. GRACE also provides guidance on other important aspects of the training process, such as how to generate data from the teacher and which teacher to choose given certain constraints.

**The Impact:** This research has the potential to make AI training more efficient and effective, which could lead to breakthroughs in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and more. By streamlining the process of selecting a teacher model, GRACE could help researchers and developers create more accurate and capable AI models."
cs.CL,Oolong: Evaluating Long Context Reasoning and Aggregation Capabilities,"As model context lengths continue to grow, concerns about whether models effectively use the full context length have persisted. While several carefully designed long-context evaluations have recently been released, these evaluations tend to rely on retrieval from one or more sections of the context, which allows nearly all of the context tokens to be disregarded as noise. This represents only one type of task that might be performed with long context. We introduce Oolong, a benchmark of long-context reasoning tasks that require analyzing individual chunks of text on an atomic level, and then aggregating these analyses to answer distributional questions. Oolong is separated into two task sets: Oolong-synth, a set of naturalistic synthetic tasks, where we can easily ablate components of the reasoning problem; and Oolong-real, a downstream setting which requires reasoning over real-world conversational data. Oolong requires models to reason over large quantities of examples, to perform both classification and counting in-context, and to reason over temporal and user relations. Even frontier models struggle on Oolong, with GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy on both splits at 128K. We release the data and evaluation harness for Oolong to enable further development of models that can reason over large quantities of text.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02817v1,2025-11-04T18:42:12Z,"Amanda Bertsch, Adithya Pratapa, Teruko Mitamura, Graham Neubig, Matthew R.

To investigate this, a team of researchers has created a new benchmark called Oolong, which tests a model's ability to analyze and reason about large amounts of text.

Oolong is designed to push AI models to their limits by requiring them to analyze individual chunks of text, and then combine those analyses to answer complex questions. The benchmark consists of two sets of tasks: Oolong-synth, which uses synthetic data to test specific reasoning skills, and Oolong-real, which uses real-world conversational data to simulate real-world scenarios.

cs.CL,"MemSearcher: Training LLMs to Reason, Search and Manage Memory via   End-to-End Reinforcement Learning","Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM context, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts, resulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the current turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This trade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge, we propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact memory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses the user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform search actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for solving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize this workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of MemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of trajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level advantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as Search-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines on seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher even outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance between information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and lower computational overhead.

Researchers have made a significant step towards achieving this goal with the development of MemSearcher, a novel AI framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to reason, search, and manage memory more effectively.

The challenge with current search agents is that they either use too much information, making them slow and computationally expensive, or they discard important information, reducing their accuracy. MemSearcher addresses this trade-off by maintaining a compact memory that is iteratively updated to retain only essential information. This approach stabilizes the context length across interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

The researchers also introduced a new end-to-end reinforcement learning framework, called multi-context GRPO, which optimizes the MemSearcher workflow. This framework allows the AI to learn how to reason, search, and manage memory more effectively.

cs.CL,Can LLMs subtract numbers?,"We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs). While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that subtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the errors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs frequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing analyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative, yet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further test well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to see if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while few-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve near-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these findings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and recoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02795v1,2025-11-04T18:20:17Z,"Mayank Jobanputra, Nils Philipp Walter, Maitrey Mehta, Blerta Veseli, Evan Parker Kelly Chapple, Yifan Wang, Sneha Chetani, Ellie Pavlick, Antonio Vergari, Vera Demberg","**Can Large Language Models Subtract Numbers?**

A recent study tested eight LLMs on addition and subtraction problems and discovered that while they perform well on addition, their accuracy drops significantly when it comes to subtraction.

The study found that LLMs often get subtraction wrong when the number being subtracted is larger than the number it's being subtracted from (e.g., 5 - 7). In these cases, the models frequently produce the correct magnitude (e.g., 2), but forget to include the negative sign (e.g., -2).

However, the researchers also found that LLMs internally understand when a result should be negative, but this information isn't always reflected in their outputs. To improve performance, the researchers tested techniques like few-shot learning (providing examples) and instruction-tuning (fine-tuning the model). They found that these methods can modestly improve subtraction accuracy, with instruction-tuned models performing particularly well.

Overall, the study provides new insights into the limitations of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities, particularly with subtraction. While LLMs have impressive abilities, they still have room for improvement when it comes to performing mathematical operations."
cs.CL,VCode: a Multimodal Coding Benchmark with SVG as Symbolic Visual   Representation,"Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically, frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i) Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing Claude-4-Opus.

Imagine being able to describe a picture using code, just like a computer program. Researchers have created a new benchmark called VCode, which tests the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) models to generate code that accurately represents visual information. This code uses a format called SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), which is like a digital drawing that can be edited and manipulated.

**The Challenge: From Images to Code**

The goal of VCode is to take an image and produce SVG code that captures its meaning. For example, if you show a picture of a cat, the AI model should generate code that describes the cat's shape, size, and features. This code can then be used for further processing, like answering questions about the image.

**Evaluating AI Models**

To assess how well AI models perform, researchers have developed a new evaluation protocol called CodeVQA. This involves rendering the generated SVG code as an image and asking questions about it. If the model answers correctly, it means the SVG code accurately represents the original image.

**The Results: A Gap in AI Capabilities**

The researchers found that even the best AI models struggle to generate accurate SVG code, revealing a gap between language-based and visual-based coding abilities. To address this gap, they developed VCoder, a new framework that helps AI models improve their visual coding skills.

**VCoder: A New Framework for Visual Coding**

VCoder uses two key strategies:

1. **Thinking with Revision**: The model iteratively analyzes and refines its SVG code to ensure accuracy.
2. **Acting with Visual Tools**: The model uses detectors and parsers to gather structured information about the image, such as objects, shapes, and text.

**The Impact: Improving AI Capabilities**

The researchers found that VCoder significantly improves the performance of AI models on the VCode benchmark, outperforming the top-performing model by 12.3 points. Human studies also showed that both humans and AI models perform better on images than on rendered SVG code, highlighting the potential of symbolic visual representation.

**What's Next?**

The VCode benchmark and VCoder framework are publicly available, providing a new standard for evaluating and improving AI models' visual coding abilities. This research has the potential to enable more accurate and efficient processing of visual information, with applications in areas like computer vision, robotics, and human-computer interaction."

In this work, we introduce a centralized multi-LLM framework, where a controller LLM selectively coordinates a pool of expert models in a cost-efficient and cost-controllable manner. We formulate this coordination problem as reinforcement learning with dual objectives: maximizing task performance while minimizing the overall inference cost. In addition, we expect the multi-agent system to have adapted behavior with different budget conditions during inference. To this end, we propose CoRL, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes the performance cost trade-off in a controllable multi-budget setting.

**Approach:** They designed a centralized system where a ""controller"" LLM decides which expert models to use for a given task, and when. This approach allows for more cost-effective and flexible use of LLMs.

**Innovation:** The researchers used a technique called reinforcement learning to train the system to balance two goals: achieving high performance and minimizing costs. They also wanted the system to adapt to different budget conditions, so they developed a framework called CoRL.

**Results:** Experiments showed that CoRL enables a single system to outperform the best individual LLM when budget is not a concern, while still performing well even with limited budgets. This approach has the potential to make AI systems more efficient, scalable, and cost-effective.

To bridge this gap, we introduce CostBench, a scalable, cost-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents' economic reasoning and replanning abilities. Situated in the travel-planning domain, CostBench comprises tasks solvable via multiple sequences of atomic and composite tools with diverse, customizable costs. It also supports four types of dynamic blocking events, such as tool failures and cost changes, to simulate real-world unpredictability and necessitate agents to adapt in real time.

cs.CL,Optimal Singular Damage: Efficient LLM Inference in Low Storage Regimes,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse applications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing capabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most applications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, even storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant challenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show that fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters, highlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This paper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models after fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that fine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for storage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or sparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model expressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified low-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank approximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method, optimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated updates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring that the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage efficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to employing the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02681v1,2025-11-04T16:05:25Z,"Mohammadsajad Alipour, Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri","Here's a summary of the research paper ""Optimal Singular Damage: Efficient LLM Inference in Low Storage Regimes"" for a general audience:

**The Problem:** Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools used in many applications, but they're huge and require a lot of storage space. This limits who can use them and how they're used.

**The Goal:** Researchers want to find a way to store these models more efficiently, especially when they're customized for specific tasks.

**The Breakthrough:** The researchers discovered that when LLMs are customized (or ""fine-tuned"") for a task, only a small part of the model's parameters change. They also found that these changes can be stored in a more compact way.

**The Solution:** The researchers developed a method called ""optimal singular damage"" that selectively stores the most important changes to the model, while discarding less important ones. This approach combines two techniques: reducing the complexity of the changes (using ""low-rank approximation"") and removing unnecessary data (using ""sparsification"").

**The Result:** The new method allows for significant storage efficiency while maintaining the model's accuracy. In other words, it enables more people to use customized LLMs, even with limited storage resources.

**In Simple Terms:** Imagine you have a huge library with millions of books, but you only need to store a few specific books. The researchers found a way to store just the changes to those books, rather than the entire library, making it much more efficient. This can help make powerful language models more accessible to more people."
cs.CL,"Understanding New-Knowledge-Induced Factual Hallucinations in LLMs:   Analysis, Solution, and Interpretation","Previous studies show that introducing new knowledge during large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning can lead to the generation of erroneous output when tested on known information, thereby triggering factual hallucinations. However, existing studies have not deeply investigated the specific manifestations and underlying mechanisms of these hallucinations. Our work addresses this gap by designing a controlled dataset Biography-Reasoning, and conducting a fine-grained analysis across multiple knowledge types and two task types, including knowledge question answering (QA) and knowledge reasoning tasks. We find that when fine-tuned on a dataset in which a specific knowledge type consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit significantly increased hallucination tendencies. This suggests that the high unfamiliarity of a particular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge, is a stronger driver of hallucinations, and these tendencies can even affect other knowledge types in QA tasks. To mitigate such factual hallucinations, we propose KnownPatch, which patches a small number of known knowledge samples in the later stages of training, effectively alleviating new-knowledge-induced hallucinations. Through attention analysis, we find that learning new knowledge reduces the model's attention to key entities in the question, thus causing excessive focus on the surrounding context, which may increase the risk of hallucination. Moreover, the attention pattern can propagate to similar contexts, facilitating the spread of hallucinations to textually similar questions. Our method effectively mitigates the disruption of new knowledge learning to the model's attention on key entities, accompanied by improved performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02626v1,2025-11-04T14:55:24Z,"Renfei Dang, Peng Hu, Changjiang Gao, Shujian Huang","**The Dark Side of Learning New Things: How AI Models Can Get Facts Wrong**

Imagine you're teaching a student new information, but in the process, they start getting facts wrong that they previously knew. This phenomenon has been observed in large language models (LLMs), which are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to understand and generate human-like text. Researchers have found that when LLMs learn new information, they can sometimes generate incorrect outputs, known as ""factual hallucinations,"" when tested on facts they already knew.

In a recent study, researchers investigated this issue by creating a special dataset called Biography-Reasoning. They found that when LLMs are fine-tuned on a dataset with entirely new information, they are more likely to generate incorrect outputs. This suggests that the unfamiliarity of new information, rather than the amount of new information, is a major driver of factual hallucinations.

The researchers also discovered that this problem can spread to similar questions and contexts, making it a significant challenge for LLMs. To address this issue, they proposed a solution called KnownPatch, which involves adding a small number of known facts to the training data. This approach was found to effectively reduce factual hallucinations and improve the model's performance.

The study also shed light on why this happens. When LLMs learn new information, they tend to focus less on key entities in the question and more on the surrounding context, which can lead to incorrect outputs. The researchers found that their method, KnownPatch, can help mitigate this issue by restoring the model's attention to key entities.

Overall, this study highlights the importance of carefully designing training data and methods to prevent factual hallucinations in LLMs. By understanding the causes of this problem and developing effective solutions, researchers can improve the accuracy and reliability of AI models."
cs.CL,The Realignment Problem: When Right becomes Wrong in LLMs,"The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values is central to their safe deployment, yet current practice produces static, brittle, and costly-to-maintain models that fail to keep pace with evolving norms and policies. This misalignment, which we term the Alignment-Reality Gap, poses a growing challenge for reliable long-term use. Existing remedies are inadequate: large-scale re-annotation is economically prohibitive, and standard unlearning methods act as blunt instruments that erode utility rather than enable precise policy updates. We introduce TRACE (Triage and Re-align by Alignment Conflict Evaluation), a framework for principled unlearning that reconceives re-alignment as a programmatic policy application problem. TRACE programmatically triages existing preference data against a new policy, identifies high-impact conflicts via a alignment impact score, and applies a hybrid optimization that cleanly inverts, discards, or preserves preferences while safeguarding model performance. Empirical results show that TRACE achieves robust re-alignment across diverse model families (Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.1-8B).

1. Identifying conflicts between existing model data and new policies
2. Prioritizing high-impact conflicts
3. Applying targeted updates to the model

**Promising Results**

Tests of TRACE have shown promising results, with the framework successfully updating LLMs across different model families and datasets. Notably, TRACE was able to enforce new principles without degrading the model's general capabilities. This breakthrough has the potential to enable more sustainable and responsible AI deployment.

cs.CL,UniChange: Unifying Change Detection with Multimodal Large Language   Model,"Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land cover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities. Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories, eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even when their class definitions conflict.

We introduce Confidence-Guided Early Stopping (CGES), a Bayesian framework that forms posteriors over candidate answers using scalar confidence signals derived from token probabilities or reward models. CGES adaptively halts sampling once the posterior mass of a candidate exceeds a threshold. We provide theoretical guarantees for both perfectly calibrated confidences and realistic noisy confidence signals. Across five reasoning benchmarks, CGES reduces the average number of model calls by about 69 percent (for example, from 16.0 to 4.9) while matching the accuracy of self-consistency within 0.06 percentage points.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02603v1,2025-11-04T14:25:54Z,"Ehsan Aghazadeh, Ahmad Ghasemi, Hedyeh Beyhaghi, Hossein Pishro-Nik","**Improving Efficiency in AI Models with Confidence-Guided Early Stopping**

Researchers have developed a new method called Confidence-Guided Early Stopping (CGES), which uses a Bayesian framework to make predictions more efficiently and accurately. CGES works by tracking the confidence of the model's predictions and stopping the querying process when the model is confident enough in its answer.

In tests across five reasoning benchmarks, CGES was able to reduce the number of model calls by about 69%, while still achieving similar accuracy to the traditional self-consistency method. This means that CGES can make predictions more quickly and efficiently, without sacrificing accuracy.

The benefits of CGES include:

* Reduced computational costs: By stopping the querying process early, CGES can save computing resources and reduce the time it takes to make predictions.
* Improved efficiency: CGES can make predictions more quickly, making it more suitable for real-time applications.
* Maintained accuracy: Despite reducing the number of model calls, CGES is able to maintain similar accuracy to traditional methods.

However, it converges slowly due to the inherent curse of dimensionality when searching for descent directions in the high-dimensional parameter space of billion-scale LLMs. We propose ConMeZO, a novel zeroth-order optimizer that accelerates convergence by adaptive directional sampling. Instead of drawing the direction uniformly at random, ConMeZO restricts the sampling to a cone centered around a momentum estimate. This concentrates the search in directions where the true gradient is more likely to lie and thus reduces the effect of high dimensions. We prove that ConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO.

The researchers found that by adding a new ""hyperparameter"" - a adjustable setting that helps the model learn - they could improve the performance of their model. They also developed a new way to measure how well the model is working, which helps them understand how to adjust the hyperparameter for better results.

stat.ML,Reducing normalizing flow complexity for MCMC preconditioning,"Preconditioning is a key component of MCMC algorithms that improves sampling efficiency by facilitating exploration of geometrically complex target distributions through an invertible map. While linear preconditioners are often sufficient for moderately complex target distributions, recent work has explored nonlinear preconditioning with invertible neural networks as components of normalizing flows (NFs). However, empirical and theoretical studies show that overparameterized NF preconditioners can degrade sampling efficiency and fit quality. Moreover, existing NF-based approaches do not adapt their architectures to the target distribution. Related work outside of MCMC similarly finds that suitably parameterized NFs can achieve comparable or superior performance with substantially less training time or data. We propose a factorized preconditioning architecture that reduces NF complexity by combining a linear component with a conditional NF, improving adaptability to target geometry. The linear preconditioner is applied to dimensions that are approximately Gaussian, as estimated from warmup samples, while the conditional NF models more complex dimensions. Our method yields significantly better tail samples on two complex synthetic distributions and consistently better performance on a sparse logistic regression posterior across varying likelihood and prior strengths. It also achieves higher effective sample sizes on hierarchical Bayesian model posteriors with weak likelihoods and strong funnel geometries. This approach is particularly relevant for hierarchical Bayesian model analyses with limited data and could inform current theoretical and software strides in neural MCMC design.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02345v1,2025-11-04T08:08:00Z,"David Nabergoj, Erik Štrumbelj","**Improving MCMC Algorithms with Smarter Preconditioning**

Below this critical scale, the effective dynamics are governed by ballistic (ODE) limits, but at the critical scale, new correction term appears that changes the phase diagram. In this regime, near the fixed points, the corresponding diffusive (SDE) limits of the effective dynamics reduces to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process under certain conditions.

SGD is like a game where the computer tries to guess the best way to recognize pictures by making small adjustments as it goes along. The researchers studied what happens to this game when the number of pictures (or ""data points"") is very large. They found that when the computer makes small adjustments quickly, its learning process behaves like a random walk. But when it makes adjustments at a certain ""critical"" speed, something new happens.

In this paper, we present FGTSVA, a variance-aware Thompson Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits with general reward function with optimal regret bound. At the core of our analysis is an extension of the decoupling coefficient, a technique commonly used in the analysis of Feel-good Thompson sampling (FGTS) that reflects the complexity of the model space. With the new decoupling coefficient denoted by $\mathrm{dc}$, FGTS-VA achieves the regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathrm{dc}\cdot\log|\mathcal{F}|\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2}+\mathrm{dc})$, where $|\mathcal{F}|$ is the size of the model space, $T$ is the total number of rounds, and $\sigma_t^2$ is the subgaussian norm of the noise (e.g., variance when the noise is Gaussian) at round $t$. In the setting of contextual linear bandits, the regret bound of FGTSVA matches that of UCB-based algorithms using weighted linear regression (Zhou and Gu, 2022).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02123v1,2025-11-03T23:25:41Z,"Xuheng Li, Quanquan Gu","**Improving Decision-Making with Variance-Aware Thompson Sampling**

One popular approach is called Thompson sampling, which works by randomly sampling possible solutions and choosing the best one based on those samples. However, most existing Thompson sampling algorithms don't take into account the uncertainty or ""variance"" of the outcomes.

Materials and methods: We illustrate a framework for incorporating clinical knowledge into a Bayesian latent class model via informative priors to guide unsupervised clustering toward clinically relevant subgroups. This approach models missingness, accounting for potential missing-not-at-random patterns, and provides patient-level probabilities for phenotype assignment with uncertainty. Using reusable and flexible code, we applied the model to a large asthma EHR cohort, specifying informative priors for T2 inflammation-related features and weakly informative priors for other clinical variables, allowing the data to inform posterior distributions.   Results and Conclusion: Using encounter data from January 2017 to February 2024 for 44,642 adult asthma patients, we found a bimodal posterior distribution of phenotype assignment, indicating clear class separation. The T2 inflammation-informed class (38.7%) was characterized by elevated eosinophil levels and allergy markers, plus high healthcare utilization and medication use, despite weakly informative priors on the latter variables. These patterns suggest an ""uncontrolled T2-high"" sub-phenotype.

These phenomena are common in many fields, including biology and image processing, but are not well-captured by traditional modeling approaches.

**The Problem with Traditional Models**

Traditional models rely on Brownian motion (BM), which assumes that the movement of particles or systems is random and memoryless. However, real-world systems often exhibit complex behaviors that cannot be explained by BM. For example, in biology, protein conformations can change over time in a way that depends on their past behavior.

**A New Approach: Fractional Diffusion Bridge Models**

FDBM uses a more realistic and flexible approach, called fractional Brownian motion (fBM), which can capture these complex behaviors. However, fBM is challenging to work with because it is non-Markovian, meaning that its future behavior depends on its entire past history. To overcome this challenge, the researchers developed a Markovian approximation of fBM, which allows for efficient inference and prediction.

**Applications and Results**

The researchers applied FDBM to two tasks: predicting future protein conformations from aligned data and unpaired image translation. In both cases, FDBM outperformed traditional Brownian-based models, achieving lower errors in protein structure prediction and image translation.

Imagine you're a doctor trying to decide which treatment to prescribe to a patient. You have multiple options, and each treatment can have different effects depending on the patient's characteristics and other factors. But how do you predict the outcome of different treatments and choose the best one?

Researchers have made a significant step forward in solving this problem by developing a new method called XTNet. This method can estimate the effects of multiple treatments, each with multiple possible values, and predict how they interact with each other.

The challenge with complex treatments is that their effects can be intertwined, making it hard to model and predict outcomes. XTNet addresses this challenge by using a novel architecture that:

1. **Captures treatment interactions**: XTNet introduces a dynamic masking mechanism that helps identify how different treatments interact with each other.
2. **Decomposes complex effects**: The method breaks down the effects of treatments into basic effects and cross-treatment interactions, making it easier to model and analyze complex scenarios.

The researchers tested XTNet on both simulated and real-world data and found that it outperforms existing methods in predicting treatment effects and ranking accuracy. They also proposed a new evaluation metric, MCMV-AUCC, which takes into account treatment costs and interaction effects.

The implications of this research are significant, as it can be applied to various fields, including medicine, economics, and social sciences, where understanding the effects of complex treatments is crucial. With XTNet, researchers and practitioners can make more informed decisions and develop more effective interventions."
stat.ML,Partial Trace-Class Bayesian Neural Networks,"Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) allow rigorous uncertainty quantification in deep learning, but often come at a prohibitive computational cost. We propose three different innovative architectures of partial trace-class Bayesian neural networks (PaTraC BNNs) that enable uncertainty quantification comparable to standard BNNs but use significantly fewer Bayesian parameters. These PaTraC BNNs have computational and statistical advantages over standard Bayesian neural networks in terms of speed and memory requirements. Our proposed methodology therefore facilitates reliable, robust, and scalable uncertainty quantification in neural networks. The three architectures build on trace-class neural network priors which induce an ordering of the neural network parameters, and are thus a natural choice in our framework. In a numerical simulation study, we verify the claimed benefits, and further illustrate the performance of our proposed methodology on a real-world dataset.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01628v1,2025-11-03T14:38:35Z,"Arran Carter, Torben Sell","Here's a summary of the research paper for a general audience:

**Making Deep Learning More Reliable and Efficient**

Deep learning models are powerful tools for making predictions, but they often lack a crucial aspect: uncertainty. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) can provide a way to quantify uncertainty, but they can be computationally expensive. A team of researchers has proposed a new approach called partial trace-class Bayesian neural networks (PaTraC BNNs) that makes uncertainty quantification more efficient and scalable.

The innovation lies in designing neural networks that use fewer ""Bayesian parameters"" while still providing reliable uncertainty estimates. This leads to significant improvements in speed and memory requirements, making it possible to apply BNNs to larger and more complex problems.

The researchers tested their approach through simulations and real-world data, and the results show that PaTraC BNNs perform well while using fewer resources. This breakthrough has the potential to make deep learning models more reliable, robust, and practical for a wide range of applications."
