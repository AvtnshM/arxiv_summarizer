cs.LG,Evolutionary Strategies lead to Catastrophic Forgetting in LLMs,"Immanuel Abdi, Akshat Gupta, Micah Mok, Alexander Lu, Nicholas Lee, Gopala Anumanchipalli",https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20861v1,2026-01-28T18:59:34Z,"**The Dark Side of Evolutionary Strategies in AI Learning**

Imagine an AI system that can learn and improve over time, like a human. However, current AI systems struggle with this, and one of the main challenges is that they tend to forget what they've learned previously when new information is added. This is known as ""catastrophic forgetting.""

Researchers recently explored the use of Evolutionary Strategies (ES), a type of algorithm that doesn't rely on traditional gradient-based learning methods, to train large language models (LLMs). While ES showed promising results in certain tasks, the study revealed a significant drawback: it leads to severe forgetting of previously learned abilities.

In other words, as the AI system learned new things using ES, it rapidly forgot what it had learned earlier. This makes it difficult to use ES for training models that need to learn continuously over time.

The researchers found that the updates made using ES are more frequent and have a larger impact on the model's parameters compared to traditional gradient-based methods. This is likely the reason behind the forgetting behavior.

The study highlights the importance of addressing catastrophic forgetting in AI systems and encourages future research to develop methods that can mitigate this issue. Ultimately, the goal is to create AI systems that can learn and adapt over time, without sacrificing previously learned knowledge.",2026-01-29T03:10:58.900412+00:00,Week of 2026-01-26,"**The Dark Side of Evolutionary Strategies in AI Learning**

cs.LG,Exploring Transformer Placement in Variational Autoencoders for Tabular Data Generation,"Aníbal Silva, Moisés Santos, André Restivo, Carlos Soares",https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20854v1,2026-01-28T18:54:27Z,"**Improving Tabular Data Generation with Transformers**

Generative models, which can create new data that resembles existing data, have struggled with tabular data - a type of data commonly found in spreadsheets. A popular type of generative model, called Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), has difficulty capturing relationships between different features in tabular data, especially when the data contains a mix of different types.

Researchers have explored using Transformers, a type of model that excels at understanding complex relationships, to improve VAEs. They tested different ways of integrating Transformers into VAEs on 57 datasets and found two key insights:

1. **Trade-off between accuracy and diversity**: When Transformers are used to process the latent representation (a compressed version of the data) or the decoder output (the generated data), they can improve either the accuracy or diversity of the generated data, but not both simultaneously.
2. **Simplistic relationships**: The researchers also found that the Transformers tend to learn simple, linear relationships between the input and output data, particularly in the decoder component.

Imagine you're trying to teach a computer to recognize different types of animals, but new species are being discovered all the time. Traditional machine learning systems would forget what they learned about previous animals, but what if there was a way to help them learn continuously?

Researchers have developed a new toolbox called C3Box, which enables computers to learn from evolving data streams without forgetting what they've learned before. C3Box uses pre-trained models like CLIP, which are excellent at generalizing and understanding semantic relationships.

The problem is that existing methods for class-incremental learning (CIL) are scattered and hard to compare. C3Box solves this by providing a unified framework that integrates various CIL methods, making it easy to experiment, compare, and reproduce results.

**Key Features of C3Box:**

* Modular and comprehensive Python toolbox
* Integrates traditional and state-of-the-art CIL methods
* Streamlined design for easy experimentation and reproducibility
* User-friendly and compatible with major operating systems

cs.LG,Post-Training Fairness Control: A Single-Train Framework for Dynamic Fairness in Recommendation,"Weixin Chen, Li Chen, Yuhan Zhao",https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20848v1,2026-01-28T18:48:43Z,"**Making Recommendations Fairer, Without Starting from Scratch**

Recommender systems, like those used by online shopping platforms and social media, can sometimes produce unfair results. For example, they might favor certain groups of people over others. To address this issue, researchers have developed methods to make these systems more fair. However, most existing methods require retraining the system every time a new fairness requirement is introduced, which can be time-consuming and costly.

A new approach, called Cofair, offers a more flexible solution. Cofair allows a recommender system to be trained just once, and then adjusted to meet different fairness requirements as needed. This is achieved through a special framework that includes a shared representation layer and fairness-conditioned adapter modules. These components enable the system to produce user embeddings that are tailored to specific fairness levels.

The Cofair framework has been tested on multiple datasets and has shown promising results. It can deliver comparable or better fairness-accuracy curves than state-of-the-art baselines, without the need for retraining. This means that recommender systems can be made more fair and adaptable, without sacrificing performance.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Cofair is a single-train framework that enables post-training fairness control in recommendation systems.
* It allows for dynamic fairness at different levels, without the need for retraining.
* Cofair has been shown to deliver comparable or better fairness-accuracy curves than state-of-the-art baselines.

**Implications:**

* Cofair has the potential to make recommender systems more fair and adaptable, which can lead to more equitable outcomes for users.

cs.LG,PatchFormer: A Patch-Based Time Series Foundation Model with Hierarchical Masked Reconstruction and Cross-Domain Transfer Learning for Zero-Shot Multi-Horizon Forecasting,"Olaf Yunus Laitinen Imanov, Derya Umut Kulali, Taner Yilmaz",https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20845v1,2026-01-28T18:45:45Z,"Here's a summary of the research paper for a general audience:

**Introducing PatchFormer: A Breakthrough in Time Series Forecasting**

Time series forecasting is a crucial task that helps us predict future trends in various fields, such as weather, energy consumption, traffic patterns, stock prices, and disease outbreaks. However, traditional forecasting methods often require a lot of labeled data and are tailored to specific domains, making them limited and time-consuming.

Researchers have developed a new model called PatchFormer, which uses a patch-based approach to analyze time series data. This model can learn from large amounts of data and apply that knowledge to different forecasting tasks with minimal additional training.

**How PatchFormer Works**

PatchFormer breaks down time series data into smaller patches and learns to represent them at different temporal scales. It then uses a self-supervised learning approach, called hierarchical masked reconstruction, to train on these patches. This approach allows the model to learn from the data without requiring labeled examples.

**Key Benefits**

PatchFormer has several key benefits:

* **Improved accuracy**: PatchFormer achieves state-of-the-art results in forecasting tasks, reducing errors by 27.3% compared to strong baselines.
* **Efficient transfer learning**: The model can adapt to new tasks with minimal additional training data, requiring 94% less data than traditional methods.
* **Scalability**: PatchFormer can handle large amounts of data, processing sequences of 512 points 3.8 times faster than other transformer-based models.

**Implications**

The development of PatchFormer has significant implications for various fields, including climate science, energy management, healthcare, and finance. Its ability to accurately forecast future trends with minimal data and computational resources makes it a valuable tool for decision-making and planning.",2026-01-29T03:10:58.900412+00:00,Week of 2026-01-26,"Here's a summary of the research paper for a general audience:

Imagine you're searching for the top 10 most similar items to a product you like on an e-commerce website. How can the website efficiently find those similar items among millions of products? One approach is to use vector spaces, where each item is represented as a numerical vector. The similarity between items is then measured by the distance or similarity between their vectors.

Researchers have long wondered: what is the minimum number of dimensions (or coordinates) required to represent these items in a vector space, such that we can accurately find the top-k most similar items? This is known as the Minimal Embeddable Dimension (MED).

In a recent study, researchers theoretically and empirically investigated the MED for various similarity measures, such as distance, inner product, and cosine similarity. They found that, surprisingly, a relatively low-dimensional vector space (specifically, $\mathbb{R}^{2k}$) is sufficient to accurately embed a large number of items and their subsets.

The study also simulated a more practical scenario, where the vector representation of a subset of items is the average of its individual item representations. The results showed that the MED grows logarithmically with the number of items, which is a promising finding.

These results have important implications for the design of efficient information retrieval algorithms. They suggest that the limitations of current methods are not due to the geometry of the vector space, but rather due to the challenges of learning the optimal vector representations.

These biases can influence the model's behavior and outputs, even when the model is fine-tuned with identical preference data.

The researchers studied 10 leading open-weight reward models and found that they exhibited significant differences in their values, such as a preference for ""agency"" (e.g., independence, achievement) or ""communion"" (e.g., social connection, harmony). These differences were linked to the base model used to initialize the reward model, with some models (e.g., Llama) preferring agency and others (e.g., Gemma) preferring communion.

The researchers argue that safety and alignment efforts should focus not only on the fine-tuning stage, but also on the pre-training stage, to ensure that AI systems are aligned with human values.

Imagine you're having a conversation with a chatbot or virtual assistant. What you say and how you interact with it can influence how it understands and responds to you. Researchers have found that language models, like those used in chatbots, can change their internal representations of information dramatically over the course of a conversation.

**What does this mean?**

In simple terms, a language model's internal representation is like a mental map of concepts and ideas. Researchers have discovered that this map can shift significantly as the conversation progresses. For example, information that was initially seen as factual may later be viewed as non-factual, and vice versa.

**Why is this important?**

These changes are not random; they're dependent on the content of the conversation. The model preserves general information but updates its understanding of conversation-specific information. This has implications for how we interpret and interact with language models. It suggests that using a fixed understanding of how a model represents information may not be accurate, as this representation can change over time.

**What are the potential applications and challenges?**

On one hand, understanding how language models adapt to context can lead to exciting new research directions. On the other hand, these dynamics pose challenges for interpretability and steering. For instance, it may be misleading to assume that a particular feature or direction in the model consistently corresponds to a specific meaning or value.

In today's industrial and service processes, vast amounts of data are generated, often with unusual patterns and outliers. Traditional methods for detecting anomalies in data, known as Statistical Process Control (SPC), can be ineffective when dealing with complex, high-dimensional data. To address this challenge, researchers have developed a new approach called VSCOUT.

**What is VSCOUT?**

VSCOUT is a hybrid method that combines machine learning and statistical techniques to identify outliers and anomalies in high-dimensional data. It uses a type of artificial neural network called a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to analyze the data and identify the most informative features. The method then uses ensemble-based filters and changepoint detection to identify unusual patterns and outliers.

**How does VSCOUT work?**

The VSCOUT approach works in two stages:

1. **Initial analysis**: The VAE analyzes the data and identifies the most informative features. The ensemble-based filters and changepoint detection then identify potential outliers and anomalies.
2. **Refinement**: The method removes the flagged outliers and re-analyzes the data using only the ""clean"" data points. This refines the analysis and provides a more accurate representation of the normal data patterns.

**What are the benefits of VSCOUT?**

The VSCOUT approach has several benefits, including:

* **Improved sensitivity**: VSCOUT can detect unusual patterns and outliers more effectively than traditional SPC methods.
* **Flexibility**: VSCOUT can handle complex, high-dimensional data with non-Gaussian distributions.
* **Scalability**: VSCOUT can be applied to large datasets and is suitable for use in AI-enabled environments.

The results show that this approach leads to significant performance gains, similar to training on moderately difficult problems, while being more efficient. Additionally, the model becomes more robust and less prone to degradation when faced with misleading information.

This method involves adjusting the way the model learns from difficult problems by focusing on specific sequences of incorrect reasoning steps that lead to failures. By doing so, the model is exposed to more informative failure-prone states, allowing it to learn from its mistakes more effectively.

The results show that this approach leads to significant performance gains, similar to training on moderately difficult problems, while being more efficient. Additionally, the model becomes more robust and less prone to degradation when faced with misleading information. The researchers also found that an iterative approach, which updates the failure prefixes during training, can lead to even better results.

Overall, this study suggests that failure-prefix conditioning is a promising method for improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs on very challenging problems.",2026-01-29T03:11:03.055160+00:00,Week of 2026-01-26

Imagine you're a researcher trying to understand the relationship between two things, like the impact of a new medicine on a disease. But, collecting complete data on both variables can be expensive, time-consuming, or even impossible. That's where machine learning predictions come in – they can help fill in the gaps.

A new approach called Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) offers a solution. PPI uses machine learning predictions from large datasets to improve the accuracy of research findings, while maintaining the integrity of the results.

Imagine you're trying to understand how a smart computer system makes decisions.

Computer scientists have made significant progress in developing artificial intelligence (AI) models that can generate code. However, these models often struggle with complex problems. To address this issue, researchers have proposed a new approach called Programming Knowledge Graph (PKG).

**The Problem with Current Models**

Current code generation models, known as Large Language Models (LLMs), are excellent at generating code but often struggle with complex problems. Another approach, called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), tries to help by retrieving relevant information from external sources. However, this approach has limitations, as the retrieval models may miss important context, and the generation models may produce irrelevant or incorrect code.

**The PKG Solution**

The PKG approach represents code and text in a more structured and meaningful way, allowing for more precise retrieval of relevant information. This is achieved by:

1. **Breaking down data into smaller pieces**: By structuring external data into finer-grained nodes, the researchers improved the retrieval granularity, enabling the model to find more relevant information.
2. **Improving retrieval accuracy**: The researchers used a technique called tree pruning to improve retrieval precision, reducing the likelihood of retrieving irrelevant information.
3. **Reducing errors**: A re-ranking mechanism was introduced to mitigate hallucinations (errors) by integrating non-RAG solutions, ensuring that the generated code is accurate and relevant.

**The Results**

The researchers evaluated their approach on two benchmark datasets, HumanEval and MBPP. The results showed significant improvements:

* Up to 20% increase in accuracy for generating correct code
* 34% improvement over baseline models on MBPP

**Improving AI Learning with Rich Feedback**

Imagine you're trying to learn a new skill, like coding or solving math problems. You try something, and if it doesn't work, you get feedback on what went wrong. This feedback can help you learn and improve faster. Researchers have been working on teaching AI models to learn from feedback like this, but current methods have limitations. They only learn from a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" outcome, rather than using the detailed feedback to improve.

**A New Approach: Self-Distillation**

The researchers introduced a new approach called Self-Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO). This method uses the AI model's own feedback to teach itself, without needing a human teacher or explicit reward system. SDPO works by analyzing the feedback it receives, such as error messages or evaluation results, and using that information to improve its predictions.

**Breakthrough Results**

The researchers tested SDPO on several challenging tasks, including scientific reasoning, tool use, and competitive programming. They found that SDPO outperformed existing methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy. Notably, SDPO was even able to learn from simple ""yes"" or ""no"" feedback by using successful attempts as a way to infer what went wrong with failed attempts.

**Practical Applications**

The researchers also found that SDPO can be used to accelerate learning on difficult tasks, achieving the same level of performance as more complex methods with fewer attempts. This has implications for real-world applications, such as AI-powered coding assistants or educational tools.

Multitask learning is a powerful technique used in machine learning to improve the performance of AI models by training them on multiple related tasks simultaneously. The idea is that by learning from multiple tasks at once, the model can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying patterns and relationships, leading to better performance on each individual task.

However, a recent study has revealed that there are limits to how well multitask learning can work, even with large amounts of data. The researchers found that, no matter how much data is collected for each task, there are fundamental statistical limits that prevent multitask learning from achieving optimal performance.

Imagine being able to generate stunning 3D images from a few snapshots, with the ability to view them from any angle. This is made possible by a new technology called 3D Gaussian Splatting. However, current methods have limitations, such as requiring a lot of input data and struggling to render images from unusual angles.

Researchers have proposed using diffusion models, a type of artificial intelligence, to improve 3D rendering. However, existing approaches have a trade-off between two important aspects: the ability to generalize to new situations (generalization) and the quality of the rendered images (fidelity). Fine-tuning diffusion models can improve quality but may not work well in new situations, while not fine-tuning them preserves generalization but may result in lower quality.

**Introducing FreeFix**

A team of researchers has developed a new approach called FreeFix, which overcomes these limitations. FreeFix uses pre-trained image diffusion models to enhance 3D rendering without requiring fine-tuning. This approach achieves a better balance between generalization and fidelity.

**How it Works**

FreeFix uses a two-step refinement strategy that alternates between 2D and 3D processing. This allows the model to refine the image quality without relying on complex video diffusion models. Additionally, the researchers propose a per-pixel confidence mask to identify areas that need targeted improvement.

**Results**

Experiments on multiple datasets show that FreeFix significantly improves the consistency of multi-frame rendering and achieves performance comparable to or surpassing existing fine-tuning-based methods.

**Improving Image Quality Assessment with Less Human Input**

Researchers have made significant progress in developing artificial intelligence (AI) models that can assess the quality of images, similar to how humans do. However, these models require a large amount of human-annotated data to learn and improve, which can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain.

In this study, the researchers proposed a new framework called LEAF, which aims to reduce the need for human annotations while maintaining accurate image quality assessment. LEAF uses a large AI model as a ""teacher"" to guide a smaller AI model, called a ""student,"" to learn how to assess image quality.

The key innovation of LEAF is that it separates the tasks of perceiving image quality and calibrating the assessment to match human opinions. The teacher model provides guidance to the student model through a process called ""distillation,"" which enables the student to learn from the teacher's experience without requiring a large amount of human-annotated data.

The researchers tested LEAF on several image quality assessment benchmarks and found that it significantly reduces the need for human annotations while maintaining strong correlations with human opinions. This makes it practical to develop accurate and lightweight image quality assessment models, even with limited human input.

**Improving Image Quality Assessment with Less Human Input**

Researchers have made significant progress in developing artificial intelligence (AI) models that can assess the quality of images, similar to how humans do. However, these models require a large amount of human-annotated data to learn and improve, which can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain.

In this study, the researchers proposed a new framework called LEAF, which aims to reduce the need for human annotations while maintaining accurate image quality assessment. LEAF uses a large AI model as a ""teacher"" to guide a smaller AI model, called a ""student,"" to learn how to assess image quality.

The key innovation of LEAF is that it separates the tasks of perceiving image quality and calibrating the assessment to match human opinions. The teacher model provides guidance to the student model through a process called ""distillation,"" which enables the student to learn from the teacher's experience without requiring a large amount of human-annotated data.

The researchers tested LEAF on several image quality assessment benchmarks and found that it significantly reduces the need for human annotations while maintaining strong correlations with human opinions. This makes it practical to develop accurate and lightweight image quality assessment models, even with limited human input.

Researchers have developed a new method called BiMoRS to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing tasks. Remote sensing involves analyzing images taken from a distance, such as from satellites or drones, to understand the Earth's surface. However, existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of remote sensing data, such as varied image quality and multiple objects in a single scene.

BiMoRS uses a two-step approach to improve the performance of VLMs on remote sensing tasks. First, it uses a model to generate textual summaries of the images, which helps to identify the key features in the images. These summaries are then combined with visual features from the images to create a more accurate representation of the scene.

The researchers tested BiMoRS on four remote sensing datasets and found that it outperformed existing methods by up to 2% on average. This improvement is significant, as it enables more accurate analysis of remote sensing data, which can be used for a variety of applications, such as monitoring environmental changes, tracking natural disasters, and managing natural resources.

The BiMoRS method is lightweight and doesn't require significant changes to existing VLMs, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.

Face recognition systems are widely used for identity verification in applications such as border control and electronic identity enrollment. However, these systems can be vulnerable to ""morphing attacks,"" where a fake image of a person's face is created by combining their features with those of another person. This can compromise the security of the system.

Researchers have proposed a new method to detect such morphing attacks, called FD-MAD (Frequency-Domain Residual Analysis for Face Morphing Attack Detection). This approach analyzes the frequency domain of facial images to distinguish between genuine and morphed faces. The method focuses on different regions of the face and uses a lightweight approach to combine evidence from these regions.

In tests, FD-MAD outperformed existing methods in detecting morphing attacks, even when the attacks were created using different techniques or when the system was tested on a different dataset.

Artificial intelligence (AI) models that generate images, known as diffusion models, have become incredibly good at creating realistic pictures. However, they can sometimes ""memorize"" and reproduce exact copies or parts of images they were trained on, which can be a problem. Researchers have been working on ways to detect and prevent this memorization.

The study found that current methods for detecting memorization only work well under certain conditions. The researchers discovered that when the AI model is close to making a final image (i.e., in a ""low-noise"" setting), memorized images have a unique characteristic: they tend to align in a specific way with the model's internal guidance. This alignment is not present in non-memorized images.

Using this insight, the researchers developed a new method to detect memorization that is faster and more effective than previous approaches. Their method can be computed directly on random noise inputs, eliminating the need for time-consuming image generation steps. In tests on two popular AI models (Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2), their method outperformed existing detection methods and was about 5 times faster than the best previous approach.

Sarcasm can be tricky to detect, especially when it's expressed through a combination of images and text. Researchers have been working on developing AI models that can identify sarcasm in multimodal content, such as memes or social media posts.

**The Problem with Current Methods**

Current methods for detecting sarcasm often rely on identifying inconsistencies between the visual and textual content.

The goal of SegRap2025 is to develop artificial intelligence (AI) models that can accurately segment (or identify) the tumor and lymph nodes from CT scans, which are used to plan radiotherapy.

The benchmark consists of two tasks: 

1. **Task01: Tumor Segmentation** - identifying the main tumor using paired CT scans from different imaging centers. 
2. **Task02: Lymph Node Segmentation** - identifying the lymph nodes using multiple CT scans from various centers and different imaging modalities (e.g., with or without contrast).

Ten teams participated in the challenge, and their AI models were evaluated on their accuracy in segmenting the tumor and lymph nodes. The top-performing models achieved an average accuracy of 74.61% on internal testing data and 56.79% on external testing data for tumor segmentation. For lymph node segmentation, the highest accuracy was 60.24% using paired CT scans, and around 60% using single-modality scans.

2. **Task02: Lymph Node Segmentation** - identifying the lymph nodes using multiple CT scans from various centers and different imaging modalities (e.g., with or without contrast).

Ten teams participated in the challenge, and their AI models were evaluated on their accuracy in segmenting the tumor and lymph nodes. The top-performing models achieved an average accuracy of 74.61% on internal testing data and 56.79% on external testing data for tumor segmentation. For lymph node segmentation, the highest accuracy was 60.24% using paired CT scans, and around 60% using single-modality scans.

The SegRap2025 benchmark provides a large-scale, multi-center, and multi-modality dataset for evaluating AI models in radiotherapy target segmentation. This work aims to develop more accurate and robust AI models that can be used in clinical settings to improve radiotherapy planning for NPC patients. The benchmark is publicly available for researchers to access and build upon.",2026-01-29T03:12:09.731825+00:00,Week of 2026-01-26

Imagine a system that can predict and prevent road maintenance issues before they occur. A crucial component of such a system is accurately classifying road surfaces, which can be challenging due to varying environmental conditions. Researchers have developed a new framework that combines camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data to improve road surface classification.

The current methods for road surface classification often struggle to generalize to different conditions, such as varying lighting, weather, and surface types. To address this, the researchers introduced a multimodal framework that fuses images and inertial measurements using a lightweight bidirectional cross-attention module. This module allows the system to adapt to different conditions and adjust the contribution of each modality (camera and IMU data).

A significant limitation of existing road surface classification methods is the lack of diverse and representative datasets. To address this, the researchers created a new dataset called ROAD, which consists of three subsets:

1. **Real-world recordings**: Multimodal data (images and IMU measurements) collected in diverse lighting, weather, and surface conditions.
2. **Vision-only subset**: A large dataset designed to test the system's robustness under adverse illumination and heterogeneous capture setups.
3. **Synthetic subset**: A generated dataset to study out-of-distribution generalization in scenarios difficult to obtain in practice.

The researchers tested their framework on the ROAD dataset and achieved significant improvements over existing methods. Specifically, their method showed:

* A 1.4% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art on the PVS benchmark
* An 11.6% improvement on the multimodal ROAD subset
* Consistently higher F1-scores on minority classes

The framework demonstrated stable performance across challenging visual conditions, including nighttime, heavy rain, and mixed-surface transitions. These findings suggest that combining affordable camera and IMU sensors with multimodal attention mechanisms provides a scalable and robust foundation for road surface understanding.

**Implications and Future Directions**

The development of this framework and dataset has significant implications for the development of environment-aware predictive maintenance systems. By improving road surface classification, cities and transportation agencies can better maintain their infrastructure, reducing costs and improving safety. Future research directions may include:

* Expanding the ROAD dataset to include more diverse and representative data
* Exploring the application of this framework to other domains, such as autonomous vehicles or smart cities

A recent study has shed light on a crucial aspect of artificial intelligence (AI) development: the influence of pre-training on AI reward models. Reward models are designed to align large language models with human values, but they are often built on top of pre-trained models. The study found that these reward models inherit value biases from their pre-training, which can significantly impact their behavior.

The researchers analyzed 10 leading open-weight reward models and discovered that they exhibit distinct preferences along certain psychological dimensions, such as ""agency"" (e.g., independence, self-reliance) and ""communion"" (e.g., social connection, community). For example, reward models based on Llama, a type of pre-trained model, tend to prioritize agency, while those based on Gemma prioritize communion.

Surprisingly, these biases persist even when the reward models are trained on the same data and fine-tuned using the same process. The study suggests that the pre-trained models' influence on reward models is not only significant but also durable.

The findings have important implications for AI safety and alignment.

**Creating Realistic 3D Humans that Interact with Virtual Environments**

Imagine being able to create virtual humans that can interact with virtual environments in a realistic and functional way. This has many potential applications, such as in robotics, video games, and virtual reality. However, creating these interactions is a challenging task, as it requires understanding both the virtual environment and the human's movements.

Researchers have developed a new framework called FunHSI, which enables the creation of 3D humans that interact with virtual environments in a functionally correct way. For example, if you want a virtual human to ""sit on a sofa"" or ""turn on a light"", FunHSI can generate a realistic 3D human that performs these actions.

The innovation of FunHSI lies in its ability to understand the functionality of objects in the virtual environment and generate human movements that are both physically plausible and functionally correct.

**Creating Realistic 3D Humans that Interact with Virtual Environments**

Imagine being able to create virtual humans that can interact with virtual environments in a realistic and functional way. This has many potential applications, such as in robotics, video games, and virtual reality. However, creating these interactions is a challenging task, as it requires understanding both the virtual environment and the human's movements.

Researchers have developed a new framework called FunHSI, which enables the creation of 3D humans that interact with virtual environments in a functionally correct way. For example, if you want a virtual human to ""sit on a sofa"" or ""turn on a light"", FunHSI can generate a realistic 3D human that performs these actions.

The innovation of FunHSI lies in its ability to understand the functionality of objects in the virtual environment and generate human movements that are both physically plausible and functionally correct. This is achieved through a combination of advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques.

**Summary:** Imagine a robot that can learn and adapt to new situations, but has limited memory and processing power. Researchers have proposed a new framework called MemCtrl, which uses advanced language models to help robots prioritize what to remember and what to forget. This allows the robot to make better decisions and complete tasks more effectively, even with limited resources.

**The Study's Findings**

The researchers tested LLMs by providing them with sentences about individuals with different gender and sexuality characteristics and asked them to complete the sentences. They found that:

* LLMs tend to produce more negative and toxic responses towards individuals who are queer or marked as such.
* These biases are less pronounced in some types of LLMs, but still present.

**The Study's Findings**

The researchers tested LLMs by providing them with sentences about individuals with different gender and sexuality characteristics and asked them to complete the sentences. They found that:

* LLMs tend to produce more negative and toxic responses towards individuals who are queer or marked as such.
* These biases are less pronounced in some types of LLMs, but still present.
* Even when LLMs are not explicitly provided with information about an individual's gender or sexuality, they still produce biased responses, often assuming a ""default"" heterosexual and cisgender perspective.

A recent study has shed light on a crucial aspect of artificial intelligence (AI) development: the influence of pre-trained language models on ""reward models"" (RMs). RMs are designed to align large language models with human values, but they are often built on top of pre-trained models. The study found that these RMs inherit value biases from their underlying pre-trained models, which can affect their behavior.

**What does this mean?**

Imagine you're trying to teach a robot to make decisions that align with human values, such as fairness and kindness. You might use a reward model to guide the robot's decisions. However, if the reward model is built on a pre-trained model that has biases, those biases can be passed on to the robot. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as the robot prioritizing certain values over others.

**The Study's Key Findings**

The researchers studied 10 leading RMs and found that they exhibited significant differences in their values, depending on the pre-trained model they were built on. Specifically, they found that:

* RMs based on the Llama model preferred ""agency"" (e.g., independence, achievement)
* RMs based on the Gemma model preferred ""communion"" (e.g., social harmony, cooperation)

These biases were present even when the RMs were trained on the same data and fine-tuning process. The researchers also found that these biases were surprisingly durable and could not be easily removed, even with additional training.

**Implications and Takeaways**

The study highlights the importance of considering the values embedded in pre-trained models when developing RMs. This has significant implications for AI safety and alignment efforts. The researchers conclude that:

* Developers should carefully choose the base model for their RMs, considering both performance and values.
* Safety and alignment efforts should start at the pre-training stage, rather than just focusing on fine-tuning and post-training.

Have you ever tried to read a company's privacy policy, only to feel overwhelmed by the dense text and complex language? You might have missed something important. Researchers have discovered a common pattern in privacy policies that can make it difficult for users to find crucial information about how their data is being used.

The pattern, called ""jurisdiction-siloed disclosure,"" occurs when companies bury specific details about their data practices in sections labeled ""California Residents"" or ""EU/UK Users.""

Imagine asking a computer program to detect hate speech or other types of problematic content online. To make these programs more effective, researchers have been experimenting with a technique called ""persona prompting.""

But does this technique really work? A new study investigated how persona prompting affects the explanations, or ""rationales,"" generated by large language models (LLMs) for tasks like hate speech detection. The researchers found some surprising results:

* While persona prompting improved the accuracy of hate speech detection, it actually made the explanations worse.
* The virtual personas didn't accurately reflect real-world demographics, and the models were resistant to significant changes.

Imagine asking a computer program to detect hate speech or other types of problematic content online. To make these programs more effective, researchers have been experimenting with a technique called ""persona prompting."" This involves giving the program a virtual personality, or ""persona,"" to influence its responses.

But does this technique really work? A new study investigated how persona prompting affects the explanations, or ""rationales,"" generated by large language models (LLMs) for tasks like hate speech detection. The researchers found some surprising results:

* While persona prompting improved the accuracy of hate speech detection, it actually made the explanations worse.
* The virtual personas didn't accurately reflect real-world demographics, and the models were resistant to significant changes.
* Despite persona prompting, the models still showed biases and tended to over-flag content as harmful.

A recent study, titled ""QueerGen: How LLMs Reflect Societal Norms on Gender and Sexuality in Sentence Completion Tasks,"" examined how Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect societal norms on gender and sexuality. The researchers found that these AI models often reproduce biased and discriminatory attitudes towards people who identify as queer or LGBTQ+, reflecting the existing societal norms.

The study tested LLMs by providing them with sentences about individuals with different gender and sexuality identities and analyzing the AI-generated completions. The results showed that:

* LLMs tend to produce more negative and toxic responses towards queer individuals, using less favorable language and showing lower regard for their well-being.
* The type of LLM used affects the level of bias, with some models producing more harmful outputs than others.
* Even when LLMs are designed to generate more neutral or positive responses, they still tend to reflect societal norms that are discriminatory towards queer individuals.

Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in solving complex problems, but their ability to reason and provide accurate answers in general domains, such as reading comprehension and medical question answering, remains limited. One of the main challenges is that LLMs lack clear feedback on their thought process, making it difficult for them to learn from their mistakes.

Researchers have proposed various methods to address this challenge, but most focus on the final answer rather than the step-by-step reasoning process. A new approach, called Probabilistic Process Supervision (P2S), aims to fill this gap. P2S provides a way for LLMs to receive feedback on each step of their reasoning process, allowing them to learn and improve more effectively.

P2S works by generating a reference reasoning chain, which serves as a gold standard for the LLM's thought process. The model then receives a reward signal for each step of its reasoning, based on how closely its thinking aligns with the reference chain. This approach enables LLMs to learn from their mistakes and improve their reasoning abilities.

One of the main challenges is that LLMs lack clear feedback on their thought process, making it difficult for them to learn from their mistakes.

Researchers have proposed various methods to address this challenge, but most focus on the final answer rather than the step-by-step reasoning process. A new approach, called Probabilistic Process Supervision (P2S), aims to fill this gap. P2S provides a way for LLMs to receive feedback on each step of their reasoning process, allowing them to learn and improve more effectively.

P2S works by generating a reference reasoning chain, which serves as a gold standard for the LLM's thought process. The model then receives a reward signal for each step of its reasoning, based on how closely its thinking aligns with the reference chain. This approach enables LLMs to learn from their mistakes and improve their reasoning abilities.

In experiments, P2S has shown significant improvements over existing methods on reading comprehension and medical question answering benchmarks. This research has the potential to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, leading to more accurate and reliable answers in a wide range of applications.",2026-01-29T03:13:39.390822+00:00,Week of 2026-01-26
stat.ML,VSCOUT: A Hybrid Variational Autoencoder Approach to Outlier Detection in High-Dimensional Retrospective Monitoring,Waldyn G. Martinez,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20830v1,2026-01-28T18:30:48Z,"**Detecting Anomalies in Complex Data: A New Approach**

In today's industrial and service processes, vast amounts of data are generated, often with unusual patterns and outliers. Traditional methods for detecting anomalies, known as Statistical Process Control (SPC), can be ineffective in handling complex data with many variables, irregular distributions, and contamination. To address this challenge, researchers have developed a new framework called VSCOUT.

**What is VSCOUT?**

VSCOUT is a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of machine learning and statistical methods to detect outliers in high-dimensional data. It uses a type of neural network called a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to identify the most informative features in the data. Then, it applies ensemble-based methods and changepoint detection to identify anomalies and contamination in the data.

**How does VSCOUT work?**

The VSCOUT approach consists of two stages:

1. **Initial Detection**: VSCOUT identifies potential outliers and contamination in the data using the VAE and ensemble-based methods.
2. **Refinement**: The approach then removes the flagged outliers and re-estimates the normal data pattern using only the clean data. This refinement step ensures that the final model is reliable and accurate.

**What are the benefits of VSCOUT?**

The VSCOUT approach has several advantages:

* **Improved sensitivity**: VSCOUT can detect anomalies more effectively than traditional SPC methods.
* **Controlled false alarms**: VSCOUT maintains a controlled rate of false alarms, ensuring that only true anomalies are detected.
* **Scalability**: VSCOUT can handle large datasets with many variables.
* **Flexibility**: VSCOUT can handle complex data distributions and contamination patterns.

**Conclusion**

The VSCOUT approach offers a practical and effective solution for detecting anomalies in complex data. Its ability to handle high-dimensional data, irregular distributions, and contamination makes it an attractive method for various applications, including industrial process monitoring and AI-enabled environments.",2026-01-29T03:11:00.484669+00:00,Week of 2026-01-26,"**Detecting Anomalies in Complex Data: A New Approach**

Researchers have made progress in developing more efficient methods for training machine learning models. One popular approach, called stochastic gradient descent (SGD), can be slow and costly to compute. To speed things up, some methods use only a subset of the data, known as a ""subspace,"" to update the model's parameters.

This study focuses on a specific type of subspace method called Randomized Subspace SGD (RS-SGD). The researchers found that RS-SGD can converge to a good solution with high probability, even when the data is noisy. This is an important result, as it provides a stronger guarantee than previous analyses that only looked at average behavior.

The researchers also proposed a new method, called Randomized Subspace Normalized SGD (RS-NSGD), which adapts to situations where the data has ""heavy-tailed"" gradients. Heavy-tailed gradients are common in modern machine learning and can make optimization more challenging. RS-NSGD uses a technique called direction normalization to improve convergence.

The study shows that RS-NSGD can achieve better performance than traditional SGD methods, even when the data has heavy-tailed gradients.

Machine learning models are increasingly used in high-stakes applications, such as predicting recidivism or selecting job candidates. However, these models can sometimes exhibit biases against certain groups of people, leading to unfair outcomes. To address this issue, researchers have developed techniques for auditing machine learning models for fairness.

A new study proposes a novel approach to fairness auditing that is both robust and efficient. The approach, called empirical likelihood-based fairness auditing, uses statistical methods to identify performance disparities across different demographic groups. Unlike existing techniques, this approach does not rely on assumptions about the underlying data distribution, making it more flexible and widely applicable.

The study demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach using a real-world dataset, COMPAS, which is used to predict recidivism. The results show that the approach can successfully identify biases against specific groups, such as African-American males under 25, who have a higher positive prediction rate, and Caucasian females, who have a lower prediction rate.

The key benefits of this approach are:

* **Distribution-free certification**: The approach can verify whether a model meets fairness constraints without assuming a specific data distribution.
* **Efficient flagging**: The approach can quickly identify specific demographic groups that experience disparate treatment.
* **Improved performance**: The approach outperforms existing methods, providing more accurate results while reducing computational time.

**Breakthrough in AI Model Efficiency**

Researchers have made a significant advancement in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) by developing a more efficient type of generative model, called rectified flows. These models are capable of generating high-quality data, such as images or text, with remarkable speed and accuracy.

**What makes rectified flows special?**

Imagine you're trying to organize a vast library with an intricate system of categories and subcategories. Traditional methods for learning and representing such hierarchical data can be inefficient, requiring a huge amount of data to achieve accurate results. Researchers have discovered that using a different mathematical space, called hyperbolic space, can significantly improve the efficiency of learning on hierarchical data.

The study reveals that traditional Euclidean representations (like the 2D or 3D space we're familiar with) have a fundamental limitation: they can't accurately capture the complex relationships between hierarchical data points without using extremely high Lipschitz constants, which leads to an explosion in the amount of data needed to learn. In contrast, hyperbolic space provides a natural fit for hierarchical data, allowing for efficient learning with much less data.

The researchers found that hyperbolic representations can learn hierarchical targets with a sample complexity of **O(mR log m)**, where **m** is the branching factor, **R** is the depth of the hierarchy, and **log m** accounts for the complexity of the hierarchy. This is a significant improvement over Euclidean representations, which require exponentially more data.

The study also reveals a fundamental bottleneck in learning hierarchical data: any simplified representation can only capture a limited number of key relationships between data points. This limitation applies to all types of representations, regardless of the mathematical space used.

Overall, the research demonstrates the advantages of hyperbolic representations for learning on hierarchical data, providing a more efficient and effective approach for a wide range of applications, from natural language processing to social network analysis.",2026-01-29T03:11:00.484669+00:00,Week of 2026-01-26,"**Unlocking Efficient Learning on Hierarchical Data**

Imagine trying to match two social networks, one from a few years ago and one from today, to see how people's friendships have changed. But what if some friendships have been added or removed by mistake, or some people have changed their names? This makes it hard to match the two networks.

Researchers have been studying how to match graphs (like social networks) that have been changed by random errors. Most previous work looked at errors that happen independently, like a coin flip. But in reality, errors can be more complex, like a ""lamplighter"" who randomly turns on or off streetlights.

This study looks at a new model of errors that happen over time, like a sequence of small changes to a graph.

But then, surprisingly, the computer's performance on new pictures suddenly improves, even though it's been trained on the same data for a long time. This phenomenon is called ""grokking.""

Researchers have now studied grokking in a simple machine learning setting called ridge regression. They found that grokking happens in three stages:

1. The computer overfits the training data.
2. It continues to make mistakes on new data for a long time.
3. Eventually, it starts to generalize well to new data.

The good news is that the researchers also found that grokking can be controlled by adjusting the training settings. They even developed mathematical formulas to predict when grokking will happen.

Their results suggest that grokking is not a fundamental flaw in deep learning, but rather a consequence of specific training conditions. This means that machine learning models don't need to be changed or redesigned to avoid grokking. Instead, the training process can be adjusted to prevent it. These findings have implications for improving the performance of machine learning models, and could lead to more efficient and effective training methods.",2026-01-29T03:11:00.484669+00:00,Week of 2026-01-26,"**Unlocking the Mystery of ""Grokking"" in Machine Learning**
