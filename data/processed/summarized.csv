cs.LG,Harnessing Data from Clustered LQR Systems: Personalized and Collaborative Policy Optimization,"**Harnessing Data to Improve Control Systems: A New Approach**

Imagine you're trying to teach a robot to perform a task, but it takes a lot of trials and errors to learn. This is because machine learning algorithms, like reinforcement learning, require a lot of data to learn effectively. However, what if you could use data from similar robots or systems to speed up the learning process?

Researchers have proposed a new approach to tackle this challenge. They focus on a type of control system called Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), which is used to control linear processes. The researchers consider a scenario where multiple agents, each with their own linear process, can be grouped into clusters based on similarities in their dynamics and tasks.

The researchers propose a new algorithm that simultaneously clusters the agents and learns a personalized policy (or controller) for each cluster. This approach ensures that the data used to learn the policy is from similar systems, which improves the efficiency of the learning process.

The study shows that this approach guarantees correct clustering with high probability and leads to policies that are close to optimal, with no additional bias. Moreover, the approach allows for collaboration between agents in the same cluster, which can lead to better performance.

The researchers also highlight that their method has a mild communication overhead, making it suitable for distributed implementation. Overall, this work presents a promising approach to harnessing data from similar systems to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of control systems.

**Key Takeaways:**

* A new approach to improve the efficiency of machine learning algorithms by using data from similar systems.
* The approach clusters agents with similar dynamics and tasks and learns personalized policies for each cluster.
* The method guarantees correct clustering and leads to close-to-optimal policies with no additional bias.

**Improving Neural Network Models for Simulating Complex Systems**

Neural networks are a type of artificial intelligence that can be used to simulate complex systems, such as turbulent flows in fluids. However, researchers have noticed that these models often perform well in initial tests, but fail to deliver accurate results when used in actual simulations. This is known as a ""performance gap.""

In a recent study, researchers found a way to bridge this gap by using two simple techniques. First, they increased the variety of training data used to teach the neural network. This helped the model learn to handle different situations and become more robust. Second, they simplified the inputs to the neural network, removing unnecessary complexity.

By combining these two approaches, the researchers were able to create neural network models that performed well not only in initial tests, but also in actual simulations.

However, one challenge is that many math problems, especially complex ones like theorem proving, don't have clear right or wrong answers that can be easily verified. This makes it hard to train AI models to solve them.

First, they used a large dataset of math problems to teach the model to recognize patterns and relationships between different steps in a math problem. Then, they fine-tuned the model on a smaller dataset of math problems where the answers could be verified.

The results showed that the new method improved the AI model's performance on several math problem-solving benchmarks. Specifically, it achieved gains of 9.86%, 5.27%, and 4.00% over the original method.

This is a major challenge for AI, especially when it encounters new situations or data that are different from what it was trained on. Researchers have proposed various solutions, but they often rely on storing past data or freezing certain parts of the AI system, which can limit its ability to adapt.

A new method, called InTAct, addresses this challenge by preserving the functional behavior of shared layers in AI systems without restricting their adaptability. InTAct works by identifying the unique ""activation ranges"" associated with previously learned tasks and constraining updates to ensure consistency within these regions. This approach allows the AI system to adapt to new situations while maintaining its existing knowledge.

**Key Benefits:**

* **Improved performance**: InTAct consistently improves performance on diverse benchmarks, increasing Average Accuracy by up to 8 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines.
* **Reduced representation drift**: InTAct reduces representation drift, which occurs when the AI system's internal representations change in ways that overwrite previously useful features.
* **Flexibility and adaptability**: InTAct is architecture-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing prompt-based continual learning frameworks, allowing for flexible adaptation to new situations.

**The Impact:**

InTAct has the potential to significantly improve the ability of AI systems to learn continuously, which is essential for applications such as:

* **Robotics**: AI systems that can learn from experience and adapt to new situations can improve their performance in complex tasks.
* **Computer vision**: AI systems that can learn to recognize objects and patterns in new contexts can improve their accuracy and efficiency.

This is similar to the challenge faced by engineers who try to control complex systems that are prone to random changes. A new research paper proposes a framework to tackle this problem.

The researchers focus on systems that are nonlinear, meaning their behavior can't be predicted by simply adding up their individual parts. These systems are also stochastic, meaning they are influenced by random factors. Think of a self-driving car navigating through a crowded city - it's a complex, nonlinear system that's also subject to random events like pedestrians stepping into the road.

The researchers propose a new control strategy that uses learning and adaptation to stabilize these unpredictable systems. The approach is based on a ""certainty equivalence"" principle, which means that the controller acts as if it's certain about the system's behavior, even when it's not. This strategy is combined with learning algorithms that improve the controller's performance over time.

The researchers derive mathematical guarantees that show their approach can stabilize the system with high probability. In other words, they can ensure that the system behaves predictably and safely, even in the face of uncertainty.

This complex problem, known as the Multi-Vehicle Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem, requires coordinating multiple vehicles to optimize routes and schedules in real-time. Researchers have proposed a new artificial intelligence (AI) framework, called the Multi-Agent Pointer Transformer (MAPT), to tackle this challenge.

The MAPT framework uses a type of machine learning called reinforcement learning to enable multiple vehicles to work together to solve the problem.

2. **Joint action generation**: MAPT combines a Transformer Decoder with a Pointer Network to generate joint action sequences for all vehicles.

cs.LG,Self-Supervised Learning by Curvature Alignment,"**Unlocking the Power of Self-Supervised Learning: A New Approach**

Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a technique used in artificial intelligence to train machines to learn from data without explicit labels. Recent advances in SSL have focused on methods that encourage the machine to learn representations of data that are invariant across different views or augmentations. However, these methods often overlook the local geometry of the data, which is essential for understanding the underlying patterns and relationships.

A new approach, called CurvSSL, has been developed to address this limitation. CurvSSL introduces a curvature-based regularizer that encourages the machine to learn representations that not only capture statistical properties of the data but also preserve the local geometry of the underlying data manifold. This is achieved by treating each data point as a vertex and computing its curvature score based on its nearest neighbors. The curvature scores are then aligned and decorrelated across different views, promoting both view invariance and consistency of local manifold bending.

**Key Findings:**

* CurvSSL and its kernel extension, kernel CurvSSL, outperform existing SSL methods, such as Barlow Twins and VICReg, on image classification tasks (MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets) using a ResNet-18 backbone.
* The curvature-regularized SSL approach yields competitive or improved linear evaluation performance compared to existing methods.

**Implications:**

* The study highlights the importance of explicitly shaping the local geometry of the data manifold in SSL.
* The proposed approach provides a simple and effective complement to purely statistical SSL regularizers, leading to improved performance on image classification tasks.

Imagine trying to understand a complex network, like a social media platform or a molecular structure. Graph representation learning is a technique that converts these complex networks into simple, compact forms that computers can easily understand. Researchers have proposed various methods, including subgraph-based approaches, which identify smaller, meaningful patterns within the network.

However, existing methods have limitations, such as requiring multiple steps, being computationally expensive, and lacking a clear connection between the patterns found and their relevance to the task at hand. To address these issues, researchers have developed DS-Span, a new framework that streamlines the process of finding and evaluating these patterns in a single step.

**Key Innovations:**

* **Single-phase approach**: DS-Span combines pattern discovery, pruning, and evaluation into one efficient step, reducing computational cost and complexity.
* **Coverage-capped eligibility mechanism**: This mechanism dynamically limits exploration once a graph is sufficiently represented, preventing unnecessary computations.

Ericsson, a leading telecommunications company, faces a significant challenge in maintaining its complex network systems. When issues arise, the company's troubleshooting team relies on a vast database of ""trouble reports"" (TRs) to identify and resolve problems quickly. However, with so many TRs to sift through, finding the most relevant ones can be like looking for a needle in a haystack.

To address this challenge, researchers at Ericsson have developed a new approach called CREST (Criterion-Specific Retrieval via Ensemble of Specialized TR models). CREST uses multiple specialized models, each trained on specific criteria, or characteristics, of the TRs. These models work together to retrieve the most relevant TRs, making it easier for troubleshooters to find the information they need.

The CREST approach has several benefits. It improves the accuracy of retrieved TRs, provides a clearer understanding of why certain TRs were selected, and helps troubleshooters resolve issues more quickly. In tests using Ericsson's internal TRs, the CREST approach outperformed a single-model approach, highlighting the importance of considering multiple criteria when retrieving TRs.

To detect these behaviors, researchers use a method called ""probing,"" which involves training a separate model to identify when an LLM is exhibiting problematic behavior.

The challenge is that examples of these concerning behaviors are rare in natural language data. To overcome this, researchers often use synthetic (computer-generated) or ""off-policy"" data (LLM responses that aren't representative of real-world behavior) to train their probes.

A recent study investigated how the use of synthetic and off-policy data affects the performance of probes. The study found that the type of training data used can significantly impact how well a probe works, and that some probes may not generalize well to real-world scenarios.

**Making AI Models More Reliable**

Deep learning models, like those used in image recognition, can be surprisingly fragile. Small changes to the input, like a tiny tweak to an image, can cause the model to make a completely different prediction. This vulnerability is a major concern for applications where accuracy is crucial.

To address this issue, researchers have proposed new ways to measure a model's robustness, or ability to withstand small changes. One approach, called probabilistic robustness, tries to quantify how likely a model is to make a mistake when faced with uncertain or noisy inputs.

The problem with existing methods is that they assume we know exactly how the input might change. In reality, it's hard to predict all possible ways that inputs could be perturbed. To overcome this limitation, the researchers propose a new method called non-parametric probabilistic robustness (NPPR).

NPPR learns to identify the most likely types of perturbations directly from the data, rather than relying on pre-defined assumptions. This approach allows for a more conservative and realistic estimate of a model's robustness.

The researchers tested NPPR on several image classification models and found that it provides a more accurate and conservative measure of robustness. In some cases, NPPR estimates were up to 40% lower than those obtained using existing methods. This means that NPPR can help developers identify potential weaknesses in their models and improve their reliability.

Imagine a camera that can capture the world in a way that's more like how our brains process information. Event cameras are a new type of sensor that don't take pictures like traditional cameras. Instead, they record changes in brightness as a stream of data, which can provide high-quality video with a high dynamic range.

It also uses a novel training framework that allows it to learn from large datasets of images, even though the event camera data is different. This enables the model to produce more realistic and detailed videos.

This can be a challenge for AI models that try to understand videos, leading to mistakes and incorrect answers. Researchers have developed a new approach called ""Video-R4"" that mimics how humans read and re-read text by pausing, zooming in, and re-examining critical regions.

**The Impact of Downsizing AI Models**

In this study, researchers investigated what happens when you downsize a large AI model that can understand both text and images. They found that reducing the model's capacity disproportionately affects its ability to understand visual information, rather than its ability to process text. This is surprising, as one might expect that downsizing would affect both visual and text-based abilities equally.

The researchers then explored whether the decline in performance is due to a loss of visual reasoning abilities or a more fundamental loss of perceptual abilities (i.e., the ability to extract relevant visual information). They found that the decline in performance is largely due to a loss of perceptual abilities, rather than visual reasoning.

Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a technique used in artificial intelligence to train machines to learn from data without human supervision. Recent advances in SSL have focused on improving the statistical properties of the learned representations. However, these methods often overlook the local geometry of the data, which is essential for understanding the relationships between data points.

The researchers behind CurvSSL demonstrated its effectiveness by applying it to image classification tasks on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets using a ResNet-18 backbone. The results show that CurvSSL outperforms or matches state-of-the-art SSL methods, such as Barlow Twins and VICReg, in linear evaluation performance. This suggests that explicitly considering the local geometry of the data can be a simple yet effective way to improve SSL.

cs.AI,Masked-and-Reordered Self-Supervision for Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards,"Here's a summary of the research paper for a general audience:

**Improving AI's Math Problem-Solving Skills**

Researchers have made progress in developing AI models that can solve math problems. However, verifying the correctness of the solutions can be challenging, especially for complex problems like theorem proving. To address this issue, the researchers proposed a new method called Masked-and-Reordered Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (MR-RLVR).

**The Problem with Current AI Models**

Current AI models can struggle with math problems because they often rely on memorizing solutions rather than understanding the underlying reasoning. Additionally, verifying the correctness of solutions can be difficult, which limits the models' ability to learn from feedback.

**The New Approach**

MR-RLVR uses a two-stage process to improve AI models' math problem-solving skills. First, the model is trained on a large dataset of math problems with intermediate steps masked or reordered. This helps the model learn to reason and think critically about math problems. Second, the model is fine-tuned on a dataset with only the final answers provided, which simulates real-world scenarios where only the outcome is verifiable.

**The Results**

The researchers tested MR-RLVR on several math problem datasets and found that it outperformed the original model by 9.86% in terms of accuracy. This means that MR-RLVR can effectively enhance the model's ability to solve math problems, even when only the final answer is verifiable.

**The Implications**

The findings suggest that incorporating process-aware self-supervised signals can improve AI models' scalability and performance in math problem-solving. This has significant implications for developing more advanced AI models that can tackle complex math problems and learn from feedback.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17473v1,2025-11-21T18:23:04Z,"Zhen Wang, Zhifeng Gao, Guolin Ke","Here's a summary of the research paper for a general audience:

Imagine a future where cars can share information with each other to stay safe on the road. This concept is called cooperative perception (CP). However, current CP systems have limitations: they require a lot of data to be transmitted, which can exceed the available communication bandwidth, and they rely on pre-defined communication partners, which can be inflexible in dynamic traffic environments.

A new approach called Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) aims to address these challenges. SRA-CP allows connected vehicles to share information with each other in a more targeted and efficient way. Here's how it works:

* Each vehicle broadcasts a brief summary of what it can see around it.
* If a vehicle detects a blind spot that could pose a risk, it initiates a targeted communication with other vehicles to get more information.
* The vehicles then share only the most critical information, prioritizing safety, and adapt to the available communication bandwidth.

The results are promising: SRA-CP achieves similar safety performance to existing CP systems while using only 20% of the communication bandwidth. It also improves perception performance by 15% compared to existing selective CP methods.

Imagine being able to teach a computer to learn new things without forgetting what it already knows. This is the goal of continual learning, a field that aims to enable neural networks to adapt to new information without losing previously learned knowledge.

Researchers have made progress in this area, but a persistent problem remains: representation drift. This occurs when the computer's internal representation of the world changes over time, causing it to forget what it previously learned. For example, if a computer is trained to recognize dogs and cats, and then later learns to recognize cars, it may start to forget what makes a dog look like a dog.

To address this issue, a team of researchers has developed a new method called InTAct (Interval-based Task Activation Consolidation). InTAct helps neural networks preserve their previously learned knowledge while still allowing them to adapt to new information.

Here's how it works: InTAct identifies the specific patterns of activity in the network that are associated with previously learned tasks. It then constrains the network's updates to ensure that these patterns remain consistent, while still allowing the network to adapt to new information.

The results are impressive: InTAct has been shown to reduce representation drift and improve performance on a range of benchmarks, including DomainNet and ImageNet-R. In fact, it has been shown to increase Average Accuracy by up to 8 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines.

cs.AI,DS-Span: Single-Phase Discriminative Subgraph Mining for Efficient Graph Embeddings,"**Breakthrough in Graph Representation Learning: DS-Span**

Imagine trying to understand a complex network, like a social media platform or a molecular structure. Graph representation learning is a technique that helps simplify these complex networks into smaller, more manageable pieces. Researchers have proposed a new method called DS-Span, which improves upon existing techniques by mining subgraphs (smaller parts of the network) in a more efficient and effective way.

**The Problem with Existing Methods**

Current methods for mining subgraphs often involve multiple phases, which can be time-consuming and computationally expensive. They also often struggle to identify subgraphs that are both relevant and unique, leading to redundant results.

**How DS-Span Works**

DS-Span is a single-phase method that combines pattern discovery, pruning, and scoring into one step. This approach allows it to quickly and efficiently identify the most important subgraphs in a network. DS-Span uses two key innovations:

1. **Coverage-capped eligibility mechanism**: This mechanism helps DS-Span focus on the most relevant subgraphs and avoid exploring unnecessary parts of the network.
2. **Information-gain-guided selection**: This selection process prioritizes subgraphs that are most useful for distinguishing between different classes or categories.

**The Benefits of DS-Span**

The results show that DS-Span outperforms existing methods in several ways:

* **Faster runtime**: DS-Span is significantly faster than existing methods.
* **More compact and discriminative features**: DS-Span identifies subgraphs that are more relevant and unique, leading to better performance in downstream tasks.
* **Improved accuracy**: DS-Span achieves higher or comparable accuracy to existing methods.

**The Impact of DS-Span**

The development of DS-Span has the potential to greatly impact the field of graph representation learning. By providing a more efficient and effective way to mine subgraphs, DS-Span can enable researchers and practitioners to better understand and work with complex networks.

Tanvir Alam","**Breakthrough in Graph Representation Learning: DS-Span**

Imagine trying to understand a complex network, like a social media platform or a molecular structure. Graph representation learning is a technique that helps simplify these complex networks into smaller, more manageable pieces. Researchers have proposed a new method called DS-Span, which improves upon existing techniques by mining subgraphs (smaller parts of the network) in a more efficient and effective way.

**The Problem with Existing Methods**

Current methods for mining subgraphs often involve multiple phases, which can be time-consuming and computationally expensive. They also often struggle to identify subgraphs that are both relevant and unique, leading to redundant results.

**How DS-Span Works**

DS-Span is a single-phase method that combines pattern discovery, pruning, and scoring into one step. This approach allows it to quickly and efficiently identify the most important subgraphs in a network. DS-Span uses two key innovations:

1. **Coverage-capped eligibility mechanism**: This mechanism helps DS-Span focus on the most relevant subgraphs and avoid exploring unnecessary parts of the network.
2. **Information-gain-guided selection**: This selection process prioritizes subgraphs that are most useful for distinguishing between different classes or categories.

**The Benefits of DS-Span**

The results show that DS-Span outperforms existing methods in several ways:

* **Faster runtime**: DS-Span is significantly faster than existing methods.
* **More compact and discriminative features**: DS-Span identifies subgraphs that are more relevant and unique, leading to better performance in downstream tasks.
* **Improved accuracy**: DS-Span achieves higher or comparable accuracy to existing methods.

**The Impact of DS-Span**

The development of DS-Span has the potential to greatly impact the field of graph representation learning. By providing a more efficient and effective way to mine subgraphs, DS-Span can enable researchers and practitioners to better understand and work with complex networks. This can lead to breakthroughs in a wide range of applications, from social network analysis to drug discovery. With its ability to quickly and accurately identify relevant subgraphs, DS-Span is poised to become a valuable tool in the field of graph representation learning.",2025-11-24T13:19:02.080870+05:30,Week of 2025-11-24
cs.AI,That's not natural: The Impact of Off-Policy Training Data on Probe Performance,"**The Impact of Training Data on AI Model Monitoring**

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful AI tools that can generate human-like text. However, they can also exhibit concerning behaviors like deception and sycophancy (excessive flattery). To monitor these behaviors, researchers use a technique called ""probing,"" which involves training a separate model to detect when an LLM is exhibiting problematic behavior.

The challenge is that examples of these concerning behaviors are rare in natural language data. To overcome this, researchers often use synthetic (artificially generated) or off-policy (data generated from a different context) data to train their probes. But how well do these probes work?

This study investigated how the type of training data used for probes affects their performance. The researchers tested probes on eight different LLM behaviors across multiple LLMs and found that:

* The type of training data can significantly impact probe performance.
* Probes trained on off-policy data may not generalize well to real-world scenarios, particularly for behaviors like deception and sycophancy.
* Using off-policy data from the same domain (e.g., similar type of text) yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain.

These findings highlight the need for better methods to handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring and to develop more effective probes that can accurately detect concerning behaviors in real-world scenarios.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17408v1,2025-11-21T17:08:48Z,"Nathalie Kirch, Samuel Dower, Adrians Skapars, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Dmitrii Krasheninnikov","**The Impact of Training Data on AI Model Monitoring**

cs.AI,Beyond Multiple Choice: A Hybrid Framework for Unifying Robust Evaluation and Verifiable Reasoning Training,"Here's a summary of the research paper for a general audience:

**The Problem with Multiple-Choice Questions**

Multiple-choice questions have been a popular way to test and train artificial intelligence (AI) models. However, researchers have found that these questions can be flawed, allowing AI models to guess the correct answer rather than truly understand the material. This can lead to inaccurate measurements of the model's abilities and encourage the model to rely on shortcuts rather than genuine knowledge.

**A New Approach: ReVeL**

To address this issue, researchers have developed a new framework called ReVeL (Rewrite and Verify by LLM). This framework converts multiple-choice questions into open-ended questions that still have verifiable answers. By doing so, ReVeL encourages AI models to think more critically and provide accurate answers, rather than relying on guesswork.

**The Benefits of ReVeL**

The researchers tested ReVeL on a large dataset and found that AI models trained with ReVeL performed better on open-ended questions than models trained with traditional multiple-choice questions. Specifically, they found that models trained with ReVeL improved their accuracy on open-ended questions by about six percentage points. Additionally, ReVeL helped to reveal that some multiple-choice benchmarks were inflated by up to 20 percentage points, providing a more accurate assessment of AI models' abilities. This means that ReVeL can help to ensure that AI models are truly learning and understanding the material, rather than just memorizing answers.

Researchers have proposed a new solution, called MoE-ViT, which uses a ""mixture of experts"" approach to selectively focus on the most relevant channels of information.

**The Problem: Too Much Information**

When analyzing multi-channel images, current methods try to compare every channel to every other channel, which leads to a huge increase in computational costs. This makes it difficult to train and use these models.

When it comes to evaluating question-answering systems, traditional methods often focus on simple word matching, which can lead to inaccurate assessments. Researchers have proposed various solutions, but they often come with drawbacks such as high costs, biases, or inconsistencies.

To address these issues, a team of researchers has developed SMILE, a novel evaluation metric that combines the best of both worlds: lexical exactness (word matching) and semantic understanding (meaning-based evaluation). SMILE balances sentence-level and keyword-level semantics, providing a comprehensive evaluation of question-answering systems.

**What makes SMILE special?**

* **Balances lexical precision and semantic relevance**: SMILE takes into account both the exact words used and the overall meaning of the answer.
* **Computationally lightweight**: Unlike some other methods, SMILE is efficient and doesn't require significant computational resources.
* **Highly correlated with human judgments**: SMILE has been tested across various tasks, including text, image, and video question-answering, and has shown to align well with human evaluations.

Researchers have made a groundbreaking discovery about how the meaning of words influences the way they are pronounced in conversational Mandarin. Specifically, they found that the pitch contours of monosyllabic words (single-syllable words) are shaped by their meanings, even when other factors like speaker identity, word duration, and surrounding sounds are controlled for.

Using advanced statistical models and machine learning techniques, the researchers analyzed a large corpus of spoken Mandarin and discovered that words with similar meanings tend to have similar pitch patterns. For example, words that are homophones (words that sound the same when spoken) but have different meanings, were found to have distinct pitch contours.

This study challenges traditional theories of Mandarin tone and provides new insights into the complex relationship between word meaning and pronunciation. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of language and could potentially inform the development of more sophisticated language models.

The researchers translated the dataset by hand with the help of Estonian translation specialists to ensure accuracy and cultural relevance.

The study found that AI models perform slightly worse on the Estonian dataset compared to the original English dataset. When the researchers used machine translation to translate the dataset, the models performed even worse. This suggests that machine translation may not be accurate enough for certain tasks.

**Improving Language Models' Understanding of Estonian**

Researchers have created a new dataset to test the language understanding abilities of artificial intelligence (AI) models in Estonian. The dataset, called Estonian WinoGrande, is a translation of a widely used English language benchmark. The researchers translated the dataset by hand with the help of Estonian translation specialists to ensure accuracy and cultural relevance.

The study found that AI models perform slightly worse on the Estonian dataset compared to the original English dataset. When the researchers used machine translation to translate the dataset, the models performed even worse. This suggests that machine translation may not be accurate enough for certain tasks.

The researchers also experimented with designing special instructions (or ""prompts"") to help the AI models better understand the Estonian language. However, they found that this approach did not significantly improve the models' performance.

cs.CL,Cross-cultural value alignment frameworks for responsible AI governance: Evidence from China-West comparative analysis,"**Ensuring AI Systems Respect Diverse Cultural Values**

As AI systems increasingly make important decisions that affect our lives, it's crucial that they align with the values of different cultures around the world. Researchers have developed a framework to evaluate how well AI systems from China and the West align with diverse cultural values. They tested over 20 leading AI models, including those from companies like OpenAI and Meta.

The study found that AI systems from both China and the West face similar challenges in respecting diverse cultural values. These challenges include:

* **Instability in value systems**: AI systems may not consistently reflect the values they are supposed to represent.
* **Under-representation of younger demographics**: AI systems may not adequately consider the perspectives and values of younger people.
* **Biases towards specific regions or cultures**: AI systems may reflect the biases of their creators or the data they were trained on, rather than being truly inclusive.

The study also found that AI systems from China tend to focus on integrating multilingual data to better understand specific contexts, while Western AI systems experiment with different architectures but often exhibit biases towards U.S. values.

**Key Findings and Implications**

* **Mistral-series AI architectures** performed better in terms of cross-cultural alignment than LLaMA3-series architectures.
* **Fine-tuning AI systems on diverse datasets** is more effective in preserving cultural variation than relying on human feedback.

Understanding how people behave on social media is crucial for creating personalized experiences and designing effective platforms. Researchers have made significant progress in predicting common actions like liking and retweeting, but rare behaviors, such as reporting harassment or sharing sensitive information, remain difficult to predict.

A recent study introduced a hybrid approach to predict both common and rare user actions on social media. The researchers analyzed a large dataset of 6.4 million conversation threads on Bluesky, a social media platform, and developed a methodology that combines four different techniques:

1. **Historical patterns**: analyzing users' past behavior to predict future actions
2. **Persona-specific models**: creating tailored models for different user groups to predict common actions
3. **Specialized neural networks**: using a unique neural network architecture to predict rare actions
4. **Text analysis**: generating text replies to better understand user behavior

The results showed that this hybrid approach was effective in predicting both common and rare user actions. The study achieved high accuracy in predicting common actions (average score of 0.64) and rare actions (average score of 0.56). This research has implications for social media platforms, as it can help create more personalized experiences and improve platform design.

Imagine you're asked a question, and someone tries to persuade you that the wrong answer is actually correct. Would you stick to your original answer, or would you change your mind to agree with them? This phenomenon, called ""sycophancy,"" is a concern for artificial intelligence (AI) models, as they may also be influenced by social pressure.

Researchers have developed a new framework called PARROT to test the robustness of large language models (LLMs) like those used in chatbots and virtual assistants. PARROT measures how well these models resist social pressure and persuasion.

The study tested 22 AI models on 1,302 multiple-choice questions across 13 domains, including international law, mathematics, and more. The results show that:

* Advanced models like GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 are less likely to change their answers (less than 11%) and maintain their accuracy.
* Older or smaller models, on the other hand, are more susceptible to social pressure, with some changing their answers up to 94% of the time.
* Weak models not only change their answers but also become less confident in the correct response and more confident in the incorrect response.

cs.CL,A Simple Yet Strong Baseline for Long-Term Conversational Memory of LLM Agents,"**Improving Conversational AI: A New Approach to Long-Term Memory**

Imagine having a conversation with a chatbot or virtual assistant that can remember your previous interactions and respond accordingly. However, current AI models struggle to maintain a coherent and personalized conversation over multiple sessions. This is because they have limited memory and can't store and retrieve information efficiently.

Researchers have proposed a new approach to improve the long-term memory of conversational AI agents. Inspired by how humans think about events, they represent conversational history as short, event-like propositions that include key details such as participants, time, and context. This approach aims to preserve information in a non-compressive form, making it more accessible and less prone to loss.

The researchers tested their approach on two benchmark datasets and found that it outperformed strong baselines, while using shorter context windows. Their results suggest that a structurally simple, event-level memory provides a solid foundation for long-term conversational AI agents. This breakthrough could lead to more natural and personalized interactions with chatbots and virtual assistants.

cs.CL,"E$^3$-Pruner: Towards Efficient, Economical, and Effective Layer Pruning for Large Language Models","**Making Large Language Models Smaller and Faster**

Large language models are incredibly powerful tools, but they require a lot of computing power and data to run. To make them more practical, researchers have been exploring ways to ""prune"" these models, or reduce their size, without sacrificing performance. A new technique called E$^3$-Pruner has shown promising results in making large language models more efficient, economical, and effective.

**The Problem with Current Methods**

Current methods for pruning large language models have limitations. They often lead to performance degradation, require a lot of training data and computational resources, and don't accelerate inference (the process of making predictions) as much as hoped. For example, simply removing layers from a model can lead to a significant drop in accuracy, making it less useful.

**How E$^3$-Pruner Works**

E$^3$-Pruner introduces two key innovations:

1. **Efficient Pruning Mask Search**: E$^3$-Pruner uses a new method to identify which layers of the model can be safely removed without affecting performance. This method is more efficient and precise than previous approaches, allowing for faster and more effective pruning.
2. **Entropy-Aware Knowledge Distillation**: E$^3$-Pruner also uses a technique called knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from the original model to the pruned model. This helps the pruned model perform better on tasks, even with fewer layers.

**The Benefits of E$^3$-Pruner**

In tests, E$^3$-Pruner achieved impressive results:

* On a large language model called Qwen3-32B, E$^3$-Pruner was able to remove 25% of the layers while still achieving 96% accuracy on a math benchmark (compared to 96.8% accuracy with the original model).
* This outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods, which achieved only 95% accuracy.
* E$^3$-Pruner also sped up inference by 1.33 times, making it faster and more efficient.

**Implications and Future Directions**

The development of E$^3$-Pruner has significant implications for the deployment of large language models. By making these models more efficient, economical, and effective, E$^3$-Pruner can help reduce the environmental impact and costs associated with training and running these models.

Imagine asking a computer to perform a complex task, like retrieving specific information from a massive database, using simple natural language queries. This is the goal of text-to-SQL technology. However, as databases grow in size and complexity, it's becoming increasingly challenging for AI models to understand the database structure and provide accurate results.

Researchers have developed a novel solution called AutoLink, which enables AI models to efficiently explore and link relevant parts of a database schema, even when the database is extremely large. This innovation addresses a critical bottleneck in text-to-SQL technology, allowing for more accurate and efficient querying of massive databases.

**The Problem: Scaling Text-to-SQL**

When using Large Language Models (LLMs) for text-to-SQL, providing the entire database schema can be impractical due to limitations on the amount of context the model can process. This can lead to irrelevant information being considered, reducing accuracy. Existing methods for filtering the schema to a relevant subset have been costly, struggled to balance recall and noise, and scaled poorly to large databases.

**The Solution: AutoLink**

AutoLink is an autonomous agent framework that reformulates schema linking as an iterative, agent-driven process. Guided by an LLM, AutoLink dynamically explores and expands the linked schema subset, progressively identifying necessary schema components without inputting the full database schema. This approach enables AutoLink to:

* Achieve state-of-the-art performance in schema linking recall (97.4% on Bird-Dev and 91.2% on Spider-2.0-Lite)
* Maintain high recall and efficient token consumption on large schemas (over 3,000 columns)
* Demonstrate robust execution accuracy (68.7% EX on Bird-Dev and 34.9% EX on Spider-2.0-Lite)

However, these methods often overlook the local geometry of the data, which is essential for understanding the relationships between different data points.

A team of researchers has introduced a new approach called CurvSSL, which incorporates a curvature-based regularizer into the SSL framework. Curvature refers to the way the data bends or curves in a high-dimensional space.

Imagine working on a project, only to realize that you've been using an outdated version of a dataset. This can lead to wasted time and effort. Researchers have developed a new tool called SAVeD (Semantically Aware Version Detection) to help solve this problem. SAVeD uses artificial intelligence to identify different versions of structured datasets, even if they don't have clear labels or metadata.

**How SAVeD Works**

SAVeD uses a technique called contrastive learning, which involves creating multiple versions of a dataset and then comparing them to each other. By doing so, the model learns to recognize similarities and differences between datasets. This allows SAVeD to accurately identify whether two datasets are different versions of the same data or completely unrelated.

**The Benefits of SAVeD**

In tests, SAVeD outperformed existing methods for detecting dataset versions. It achieved higher accuracy and was better at distinguishing between related and unrelated datasets. This means that researchers and data scientists can save time and effort by using SAVeD to quickly identify the correct version of a dataset.

**The Impact of SAVeD**

The development of SAVeD has significant implications for data science and related fields.

Imagine working on a project, only to realize that you've been using an outdated version of a dataset. This can lead to wasted time and effort. Researchers have developed a new tool called SAVeD (Semantically Aware Version Detection) to help solve this problem. SAVeD uses artificial intelligence to identify different versions of structured datasets, even if they don't have clear labels or metadata.

**How SAVeD Works**

SAVeD uses a technique called contrastive learning, which involves creating multiple versions of a dataset and then comparing them to each other. By doing so, the model learns to recognize similarities and differences between datasets. This allows SAVeD to accurately identify whether two datasets are different versions of the same data or completely unrelated.

**The Benefits of SAVeD**

In tests, SAVeD outperformed existing methods for detecting dataset versions. It achieved higher accuracy and was better at distinguishing between related and unrelated datasets. This means that researchers and data scientists can save time and effort by using SAVeD to quickly identify the correct version of a dataset.

**The Impact of SAVeD**

The development of SAVeD has significant implications for data science and related fields. By making it easier to detect different versions of datasets, SAVeD can help reduce errors and improve the overall efficiency of data-driven projects.

stat.ML,DAPS++: Rethinking Diffusion Inverse Problems with Decoupled Posterior Annealing,"**Breakthrough in Image Restoration: DAPS++ Improves Efficiency and Accuracy**

Imagine trying to restore a blurry or noisy image to its original clarity. Researchers have been working on a technique called diffusion-based image restoration, which uses artificial intelligence to solve this problem. However, the way this technique works has been a bit of a mystery. A new study, ""DAPS++: Rethinking Diffusion Inverse Problems with Decoupled Posterior Annealing,"" sheds light on how this technique works and proposes a significant improvement.

The researchers found that the current method uses two main components: a ""prior"" that provides general guidance and a ""likelihood"" term that ensures the restored image matches the original measurement. However, the prior doesn't play a significant role in guiding the restoration process. Instead, the technique relies heavily on the likelihood term.

The researchers propose a new approach, called DAPS++, which decouples the diffusion stage from the data-driven refinement stage. This allows the likelihood term to guide the restoration process more directly, resulting in improved efficiency and accuracy.

**Key Benefits of DAPS++:**

* **Fewer computations required**: DAPS++ needs fewer calculations to achieve high-quality results, making it computationally efficient.
* **Robust performance**: DAPS++ provides reliable and accurate results across various image restoration tasks, such as denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution.

stat.ML,Diffusion-Inversion-Net (DIN): An End-to-End Direct Probabilistic Framework for Characterizing Hydraulic Conductivities and Quantifying Uncertainty,"**Unlocking the Secrets of Groundwater Flow**

Imagine trying to understand how water moves underground. It's a complex process that involves predicting how water flows through soil and rock. Scientists have developed a new tool called the Diffusion-Inversion-Net (DIN) to help them better understand this process.

**The Problem: Characterizing Hydraulic Conductivities**

The key to understanding groundwater flow is knowing how easily water can pass through different types of soil and rock, a property called hydraulic conductivity. However, measuring this property directly is difficult and expensive. Scientists often rely on indirect measurements, such as observing how water levels change in wells or how pollutants move through the soil.

**The Solution: Diffusion-Inversion-Net (DIN)**

The DIN framework uses a type of artificial intelligence called a probabilistic model to combine different types of data and generate multiple possible scenarios of how water flows underground. This approach allows scientists to:

1. **Characterize hydraulic conductivities**: DIN can estimate the hydraulic conductivity of soil and rock, which is essential for understanding groundwater flow.
2. **Quantify uncertainty**: DIN provides a way to quantify the uncertainty associated with these estimates, which is critical for making informed decisions.

**How it Works**

The DIN framework uses a technique called denoising diffusion probabilistic modeling to generate multiple possible scenarios of hydraulic conductivity. This approach involves:

1. **Training a model**: The model is trained on a large dataset of possible hydraulic conductivity scenarios.
2. **Conditioning on data**: The model is then conditioned on observational data, such as hydraulic head and solute concentration data.
3. **Generating scenarios**: The model generates multiple possible scenarios of hydraulic conductivity that are consistent with the observational data.

**The Benefits**

The DIN framework offers several advantages over traditional methods:

* **Faster and more efficient**: DIN can produce multiple scenarios quickly, without requiring repeated simulations.
* **More accurate**: DIN can accurately estimate hydraulic conductivity fields and quantify uncertainty.
* **Flexible**: DIN can work with different types of data and can handle complex, non-Gaussian distributions.

Imagine you're trying to identify clusters or communities within a large network, such as social media groups or biological networks. Researchers have been working on developing algorithms to do this efficiently and accurately. A new study has made a significant breakthrough in this area.

The researchers have developed a fast and robust algorithm that can detect communities in networks with a high degree of accuracy, even when some nodes (or points) in the network are corrupted or noisy. This algorithm works by identifying clusters of nodes that are densely connected within themselves, but sparsely connected to other clusters.

The study shows that this algorithm achieves the optimal rate of accuracy, known as the minimax rate, in detecting communities near a certain threshold, known as the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold. This threshold is a critical boundary beyond which community detection becomes much harder.

What's remarkable about this algorithm is that it can tolerate a significant amount of noise or corruption in the network, specifically up to a fraction of nodes that is exponentially small. This is a significant improvement over previous algorithms, which required much stronger assumptions or were computationally inefficient.

stat.ML,Toward Valid Generative Clinical Trial Data with Survival Endpoints,"**Advancing Clinical Trials with Artificial Intelligence: A New Approach to Generating Reliable Data**

Clinical trials are crucial for developing new treatments, but they face significant challenges, including slow enrollment, high costs, and difficulty in finding participants, especially for rare diseases and cancer research. To address these issues, researchers are exploring the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate synthetic control groups, which can help augment or replace traditional control groups.

A major hurdle in generating synthetic control groups is accurately modeling time-to-event outcomes, such as how long patients survive or experience disease progression. Current AI-based approaches have limitations, requiring large amounts of data, being unstable, and relying on unrealistic assumptions.

In a recent study, researchers introduced a new AI model called a variational autoencoder (VAE) that generates both patient characteristics and survival outcomes in a unified framework. This approach does not rely on unrealistic assumptions and can handle situations where patient data is limited or censored (i.e., not all patient outcomes are observed).

The study evaluated the VAE model using simulated and real clinical trial data, considering two scenarios: (1) sharing synthetic data while maintaining patient privacy and (2) augmenting control groups to balance treatment and control groups. The results showed that the VAE model outperformed existing approaches in terms of accuracy, usefulness, and data protection.

Clinical trials are crucial for developing new treatments, but they face significant challenges, including slow enrollment, high costs, and difficulty in finding participants, especially for rare diseases and cancer research. To address these issues, researchers are exploring the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate synthetic control groups, which can help augment or replace traditional control groups.

A major hurdle in generating synthetic control groups is accurately modeling time-to-event outcomes, such as how long patients survive or experience disease progression. Current AI-based approaches have limitations, requiring large amounts of data, being unstable, and relying on unrealistic assumptions.

In a recent study, researchers introduced a new AI model called a variational autoencoder (VAE) that generates both patient characteristics and survival outcomes in a unified framework. This approach does not rely on unrealistic assumptions and can handle situations where patient data is limited or censored (i.e., not all patient outcomes are observed).

The study evaluated the VAE model using simulated and real clinical trial data, considering two scenarios: (1) sharing synthetic data while maintaining patient privacy and (2) augmenting control groups to balance treatment and control groups. The results showed that the VAE model outperformed existing approaches in terms of accuracy, usefulness, and data protection.

However, the study also revealed that the model's performance can be affected by errors in statistical analysis, which can lead to incorrect conclusions. To address this issue, the researchers proposed a post-generation selection procedure to improve the model's calibration.

stat.ML,Correlation-Aware Feature Attribution Based Explainable AI,"**Making AI More Transparent: A New Approach to Explainable AI**

As AI models become more complex and are used in high-stakes applications, it's increasingly important to understand how they make decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to provide transparency and trust in AI systems. However, existing methods to explain AI models can be computationally expensive, unstable, and difficult to scale to large datasets.

Researchers have developed a new approach called ExCIR (Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio), which addresses these limitations. ExCIR is a correlation-aware attribution score that helps identify the most important features contributing to a model's predictions. It works by analyzing the relationships between features and model outputs, and it can do so efficiently, even with large datasets.

ExCIR has two key innovations:

1. **Efficient evaluation**: ExCIR uses a lightweight transfer protocol that allows it to reproduce full-model rankings using only a fraction of the data, making it much faster than existing methods.
2. **Handling correlated features**: ExCIR introduces a groupwise extension called BlockCIR, which scores sets of correlated features as a single unit. This helps mitigate issues with correlated features, such as double-counting or unstable rankings.

The researchers tested ExCIR on a variety of datasets, including text, tabular, signal, and image data. They found that ExCIR:

* Provides trustworthy agreement with established global baselines and the full model
* Delivers consistent top-k rankings across settings
* Reduces runtime via lightweight evaluation on a subset of rows

Overall, ExCIR offers a computationally efficient, consistent, and scalable approach to explainable AI, making it suitable for real-world deployment.

stat.ML,Optimal Fairness under Local Differential Privacy,"**Improving Fairness in Data Analysis while Protecting Sensitive Information**

Researchers have made a significant breakthrough in ensuring fairness in data analysis while protecting sensitive information. They developed a new method called Optimal Fairness under Local Differential Privacy (LDP) to reduce unfairness in data and improve fairness in machine learning models.

**The Problem:** Machine learning models can sometimes produce biased results, unfairly discriminating against certain groups of people. This can happen when the data used to train the models contains sensitive information, such as age, sex, or ethnicity.

**The Solution:** The researchers created a method that protects sensitive information while reducing unfairness in data. This method, called LDP, adds noise to the data to conceal individual identities and prevent biased results. The researchers derived a mathematical formula to optimize LDP for binary sensitive attributes (e.g., yes/no) and developed a framework to apply it to multi-valued attributes (e.g., multiple categories).

**Key Findings:**

* Reducing data unfairness leads to lower unfairness in classification results.
* The new LDP mechanism outperforms existing methods in reducing data unfairness across diverse datasets and fairness metrics.
* The method maintains accuracy close to that of non-private models, which means it doesn't compromise the model's performance.

**Implications:** This research highlights LDP as a effective technique for ensuring fairness in data analysis while protecting sensitive information. The method can be used as a pre-processing step to improve fairness in machine learning models, making them more reliable and trustworthy.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16377v1,2025-11-20T14:00:15Z,"Hrad Ghoukasian, Shahab Asoodeh","**Improving Fairness in Data Analysis while Protecting Sensitive Information**

**Understanding How Neural Networks Make Predictions**

Neural networks are powerful tools used in many applications, but it's often unclear how they make their predictions. To better understand this, researchers use ""probes"" to analyze the internal workings of these networks. However, the reliability of these probes has been questioned, as they can sometimes produce accurate results but then suddenly fail.

**A New Principle for Probe Stability**

This study identifies a key reason behind this phenomenon: the way the probe interacts with the network's internal representations. The researchers formalize this as the Spectral Identifiability Principle (SIP), which provides a simple condition to check if a probe is likely to be stable. In essence, the SIP states that if the network's internal representations are well-separated and distinct, the probe is more likely to produce accurate and reliable results.

**What Does This Mean?**

Imagine you're trying to distinguish between different types of images. If the images are very similar, it's hard to tell them apart. But if they're very different, it's easy. The SIP says that if the network's internal representations are like distinct images, the probe will work well. But if they're similar, the probe may not work reliably.

**A Diagnostic Tool for Probe Reliability**

The study provides a practical diagnostic tool to evaluate probe reliability. By analyzing the network's internal representations, researchers can anticipate whether a probe is likely to be unreliable before it causes problems. This can help improve the evaluation of neural networks and ensure that their predictions are accurate and trustworthy.

Scientists have made a surprising discovery about how to improve the clarity of speech in noisy or echoey environments.

However, a new study suggests that the phase component may not be as crucial as thought.

They found that the echoes essentially add random noise to the phase component, making it less useful for removing echoes. To test this idea, they trained computer models to remove echoes using different approaches. Surprisingly, they found that excluding the phase component from the model actually improved its performance.
