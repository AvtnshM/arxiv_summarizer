Researchers have developed a new method to better understand how bladder cancer tumors respond to combination therapy, a treatment that uses multiple approaches to fight the disease. The challenge is that biological data on tumor growth and treatment response is often limited and scattered, making it hard to model and predict how the cancer will evolve over time.

To overcome this, the researchers used a cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) approach called physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). This method allows them to learn how the interactions between cancer cells and immune cells change over time, even with limited data.

The study demonstrated that their approach can accurately predict the behavior of bladder cancer tumors and immune cells in response to combination therapy, even at time points where no data was available. This breakthrough provides a powerful tool for understanding how cancer treatments work and how to improve them.

Researchers have developed a new system called DREX, which enables large language models to process requests more efficiently while maintaining output quality. The system, called Dynamic Rebatching, reorganizes requests in real-time to take advantage of ""early-exit"" capabilities, where simpler requests can be processed with fewer computational resources.

**The Problem:** Traditional language models process requests in batches, but this can lead to inefficiencies when some requests are simpler than others. Early-exit models can exit early for simpler requests, but existing batching methods can force these requests to wait or compromise on quality.

**The Solution:** DREX dynamically regroups requests at each early-exit point, allowing simpler requests to be processed immediately while more complex ones are held and rebatched. This approach avoids data movement and uses an intelligent scheduler to predict when rebatching will be beneficial.

**The Result:** DREX improves throughput by 2-12% compared to existing methods while preserving output quality.

Traditional communication methods transmit raw data, which can be slow and inefficient, especially in applications like virtual reality, remote sensing, or video conferencing. Current solutions try to identify the most important parts of an image, but they often struggle with complex scenes.

**A New Solution: Multi-Modal Semantic Communication**

To address this challenge, researchers have developed a new framework called Multi-Modal Semantic Communication. This system uses a combination of text-based queries and visual data to identify the most relevant information to transmit. For example, if you want to share a picture of a sunset with a friend, you could type ""show me the colors of the sky"" and the system would focus on transmitting that specific information.

**How it Works**

The system works by:

1. Using text-based queries to guide the information extraction process
2. Identifying the most relevant parts of an image using a cross-modal attention mechanism
3. Transmitting only the most important image patches at adaptive resolutions
4. Reconstructing the patches at the receiver's end to preserve task-critical information

**Benefits and Potential Applications**

Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools that can understand and generate human-like text. However, their inner workings are often mysterious and difficult to understand. Researchers have proposed a new approach called Activation Oracles (AOs) to shed light on LLMs' internal processes.

**What are Activation Oracles?**

AOs are LLMs trained to accept the internal ""activations"" of another LLM as input and answer questions about them in natural language. Think of it like a translator that helps explain what's happening inside a complex machine.

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found that AOs can surprisingly well understand and explain the internal workings of LLMs, even when faced with situations they were not trained on. They tested AOs on four different tasks and compared their performance to other methods. The results showed that AOs can:

* Recover information that was fine-tuned into a model, but not present in the input text
* Generalize well to new situations, even when trained on limited data
* Improve performance with more diverse training data

**Why is this important?**

The study suggests that AOs can be a powerful tool for understanding and interpreting LLMs. By training AOs to answer natural-language queries, researchers can gain insights into the internal workings of LLMs and potentially improve their performance and trustworthiness. This has significant implications for the development and deployment of LLMs in various applications.",2025-12-18T02:24:51.065649+00:00,Week of 2025-12-15,"Here's a summary of the research paper for a general audience:

Researchers have developed a new method called Solution Flow Models (SoFlow) that can generate high-quality images in just one step. This is a significant improvement over existing methods that require multiple steps to produce an image, making them slow and inefficient.

**The Problem with Current Methods**

Current methods, such as diffusion and Flow Matching models, use a multi-step process to generate images. This process is similar to gradually refining a blurry image until it becomes clear. However, this process is computationally expensive and time-consuming.

**The SoFlow Solution**

SoFlow addresses this problem by using a one-step process to generate images from scratch. The researchers developed two key components: a Flow Matching loss and a solution consistency loss. These components enable the model to learn how to generate images quickly and efficiently.

The researchers tested SoFlow on a large dataset of images (ImageNet 256x256) and found that it outperformed existing methods (MeanFlow) in terms of image quality. Specifically, SoFlow achieved better FID-50K scores, which measure the quality of generated images.

Large language models are incredibly powerful tools, but they need to be adapted to specific tasks to work effectively. One way to do this is by fine-tuning the model on a specific dataset, which can be done in two main ways: full fine-tuning (SFT) or a more efficient method called Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

Researchers recently explored the trade-offs of using LoRA, specifically looking at how the ""rank"" of the model affects its performance. The rank refers to a key configuration setting that determines how much information the model uses to make predictions. The team tested LoRA with different rank values on several datasets, comparing its performance to SFT.

Their findings showed that LoRA can perform just as well as, or even better than, SFT on certain tasks, especially those that require reasoning.

Imagine you're trying to teach a child to ride a bike. You want them to learn quickly and efficiently, but you're not sure how to optimize the learning process. Researchers are facing a similar challenge with neural networks, a type of artificial intelligence inspired by the human brain. In a recent study, scientists explored how neural networks learn and improve over time, focusing on the ""optimal learning point"" where the network is learning most effectively.

The researchers found that the learning performance of neural networks is influenced by a mathematical object called the Hessian matrix, which describes the shape of the loss function (a measure of how well the network is doing). They discovered that the smaller eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix play a crucial role in determining how well the network learns over time.

To understand this better, think of the Hessian matrix like a landscape with hills and valleys. The eigenvalues represent the steepness of the slopes. The researchers found that the smaller eigenvalues, which correspond to gentler slopes, are essential for long-term learning.

The study also explored how the Hessian matrix changes for different types of neural networks, including linear and non-linear networks. They found that for linear networks, the Hessian matrix follows a specific pattern, while for non-linear networks, the pattern is more complex.

One key takeaway from the study is that the rank of the Hessian matrix (a measure of its complexity) can be seen as an effective number of parameters for networks using polynomial activation functions. This means that the network is able to learn and adapt more efficiently.

The researchers also tested their findings with different types of activation functions, which are like the ""rules"" that the network uses to learn.

Their findings show that while N-simplicial attention can capture more complex interactions, it can also suffer from a problem called ""over-smoothing"", where important details are lost.

Image compression is a crucial technology that helps reduce the size of images, making them easier to store and share. However, traditional methods of evaluating image compression quality often rely on simple mathematical formulas that don't always align with human perception.

Researchers have proposed a new approach that leverages the power of vision-language models (VLMs), a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that can understand and describe visual content. Surprisingly, these models can accurately replicate human judgments about image quality without any additional training.

VLIC uses a diffusion-based approach, which involves iteratively refining the image compression process to produce high-quality images. The system is then fine-tuned using binary judgments from VLMs, which indicate whether one image is better or worse than another. This approach allows VLIC to learn from human preferences and produce images that are more aligned with human perception.

The results are impressive: VLIC achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on human-aligned visual compression, depending on the dataset. This means that the compressed images are not only smaller, but also more visually appealing to humans. The researchers also conducted extensive user studies to validate their approach, which showed that VLIC produces images that are preferred by humans.

To address this, some solutions have been proposed, such as converting long texts into visual representations, like images, which can be more compact and efficient.

However, it's unclear how well these models can understand these compressed visual representations. To investigate this, researchers created a new benchmark called VTCBench, which tests VLMs on three key tasks:

1. **Retrieval**: Can the model find and gather information from a long text or conversation?
2. **Reasoning**: Can the model make connections between ideas or facts that aren't directly stated?
3. **Memory**: Can the model answer questions about a long conversation or text?

The researchers tested several leading AI models on these tasks and found that, surprisingly, most models struggled to understand the compressed visual representations. While they could recognize text in images, they failed to capture the relationships between ideas or facts in the long conversations or texts.

This study highlights the need for more research into designing efficient and scalable VLMs that can truly understand long contexts, even with compressed text.

Imagine you're trying to teach a child to recognize different types of animals. You show them a picture of a cat and say ""this is a cat."" But what if you only show them a small part of the picture, like the cat's ear? They might think the ear is a different animal altogether. This is similar to what happens when machines learn from ""soft labels"" - labels that are generated by other machines and can be imprecise.

Researchers have found that when machines learn from soft labels, they can get confused and think that a small part of an image is actually a different class. This is called ""local semantic drift."" To fix this problem, the researchers looked at ""hard labels"" - simple, clear labels that say exactly what the image is. They found that using hard labels in combination with soft labels can help machines learn more accurately.

The researchers developed a new approach called HALD (Hard Label for Alleviating Local Semantic Drift), which uses hard labels to correct mistakes and soft labels to provide detailed information. They tested this approach on large datasets and found that it improved machine learning performance, even when using much less storage space. For example, on the ImageNet-1K dataset, HALD achieved a 42.7% accuracy with only 285M storage for soft labels, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art method by 9.0%.

In simple terms, the researchers found that hard labels can play a crucial role in helping machines learn more accurately, and that combining hard and soft labels can lead to better results. This discovery could lead to more efficient and effective machine learning, with potential applications in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and more.

MoonSeg3R builds on a recent Reconstructive Foundation Model (RFM) called CUT3R, which provides reliable geometric information from a single RGB image. The technology consists of three key components:

1. **Self-supervised query refinement**: This module transforms 2D object masks into 3D ""queries"" that help identify objects in 3D space.
2. **3D query index memory**: This component ensures that the 3D queries are consistent over time, allowing the system to track objects as they move.
3. **State-distribution token**: This acts as a unique identifier for each object mask, enabling the system to fuse information across frames.

**What are the implications?**

The MoonSeg3R technology has the potential to enable a wide range of applications, from robotics and autonomous driving to augmented reality and computer vision. Its ability to perform online monocular 3D segmentation with high accuracy could revolutionize the way we interact with and understand 3D environments.

**The results**

Remote sensing image analysis is crucial for understanding and monitoring our environment, but it faces a significant challenge: there is a lack of labeled data to train artificial intelligence (AI) models. This makes it difficult to adapt these models to work effectively with remote sensing images, which are often taken from overhead.

Researchers have been exploring ways to improve the performance of AI models on remote sensing images with limited labeled data. One approach is to use a concept-driven framework called SAM3, which generates masks (or segmentations) from textual prompts. This means that instead of training a model specifically for remote sensing images, you can simply provide a text description of what you want the model to identify.

The study evaluated the effectiveness of SAM3 on four different types of remote sensing targets, using different prompting strategies (text-only, geometric, and a combination of both) and varying amounts of labeled data for fine-tuning. The results showed that:

* Combining semantic (meaning-based) and geometric cues (shape and location) yielded the best performance across all targets and metrics.
* Text-only prompting performed poorly, especially for irregularly shaped targets, due to limited alignment between the model's textual representations and the overhead images.
* However, textual prompting with light fine-tuning offered a good trade-off between performance and effort required for geometrically regular and visually salient targets.
* A modest amount of geometric annotation effort was sufficient for effective adaptation.

The study also found that errors in remote sensing image analysis, such as under-segmentation and boundary inaccuracies, remain prevalent, particularly for irregular and less prevalent targets.

Overall, the research suggests that SAM3 can be an effective approach for remote sensing image segmentation, especially when combined with geometric cues and modest amounts of labeled data.

**Improving Text-to-Image and Text-to-Video Generation**

Researchers have made a breakthrough in improving the quality of text-to-image and text-to-video generation models, which are used to create images and videos based on text descriptions. The key to this improvement is a new method called GRAN-TED, which helps to create better text embeddings - essentially, a way of representing text in a way that computers can understand.

**The Challenge**

The challenge is that text embeddings play a crucial role in determining how well these models work, but it's hard to evaluate and improve them. The researchers identified two main problems: it's expensive and time-consuming to test how well a text embedding works, and it's difficult to adapt pre-trained language models to work well with visual synthesis.

**The Solution**

To address these challenges, the researchers developed GRAN-TED, which consists of two main components. First, they created a new benchmark called TED-6K, which allows researchers to quickly and efficiently evaluate the quality of a text embedding. Second, they developed a new method for training text embeddings, which involves a two-stage process of fine-tuning and layer-wise weighting.

**The Results**

The results are impressive: the GRAN-TED encoder achieved state-of-the-art performance on TED-6K and led to significant improvements in text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks.

Imagine a robot that can learn to perform complex tasks, like assembling furniture or cooking, by simply watching videos of humans doing them. Researchers have made a significant step towards this goal with the development of Mimic-Video, a novel approach to training robots.

Currently, robots are trained using Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs), which rely on large amounts of data from the internet, such as images and text. However, these models struggle to understand the physical world and require massive amounts of additional data to learn tasks like grasping and manipulation.

Mimic-Video takes a different approach by using videos to train robots.

Researchers have proposed a new approach called Activation Oracles (AOs) to interpret LLM activations, which are the internal signals that drive the model's decisions.

**What are Activation Oracles?**

Activation Oracles are LLMs trained to accept LLM activations as inputs and answer questions about them in natural language. This approach is simpler and more general than existing methods, which often rely on complex and specialized techniques.

**Key Findings**

Researchers found that AOs can:

1. **Recover hidden information**: AOs can retrieve information that was fine-tuned into a model, even if it doesn't appear in the input text. For example, if a model was fine-tuned to know a person's biography, the AO can retrieve that information even if the input text doesn't mention it.
2. **Generalize well**: AOs can perform well on tasks they were not specifically trained for, and their performance improves with more diverse training data. This means that AOs can adapt to new situations and tasks, making them a promising tool for understanding LLMs.
3. **Match or exceed existing methods**: The best AOs performed as well as or better than existing methods on most tasks, demonstrating their effectiveness in understanding LLM activations.

**Implications**

This graph helps to identify the causal relationships between the input, previous outputs, and the final output.

The results show that CAGE significantly improves the accuracy of context attributions, achieving gains of up to 40% compared to existing methods.

**Improving AI Reasoning with a New Framework**

Researchers have developed a new framework called Stepwise Think-Critique (STC) to improve the way artificial intelligence (AI) models reason and solve complex problems. Currently, most AI models, known as large language models (LLMs), either generate solutions without checking their accuracy or rely on separate tools to verify their answers. This can lead to errors and make it harder to understand how the AI arrived at its solution.

The STC framework is inspired by human critical thinking, where we evaluate and refine our thoughts as we go. With STC, the AI model thinks and critiques its own reasoning at each step, allowing it to converge on more accurate solutions. This approach also provides more transparent and interpretable explanations of the AI's thought process.

In tests on mathematical reasoning problems, STC showed impressive results, demonstrating strong critical thinking capabilities and producing more understandable reasoning traces.

Large language models are increasingly being used for various tasks, but they often need to be adapted to perform well on specific tasks. This adaptation process is called fine-tuning. There are two main approaches to fine-tuning: full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). PEFT methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), are popular because they are computationally efficient.

But how much efficiency is too much? Researchers investigated the trade-offs of using LoRA with different ""rank"" values, which affect how much of the model's information is retained during fine-tuning. They tested LoRA and SFT on multiple datasets, evaluating their performance on both in-domain (related) and out-of-domain (unrelated) tasks.

Imagine a future where vehicles drive in close formation, like a road train, to improve efficiency and safety. This concept, called vehicular platooning, relies on communication between vehicles to maintain stability and prevent accidents. However, with multiple vehicles sharing information, there's a risk of malicious actors injecting false data, which could lead to catastrophic consequences.

Researchers have made a significant advancement in learning how objects move and interact in the physical world. They've developed a new approach that uses geometric algebra neural networks to model object-centric dynamics. This approach provides a ""soft"" geometric inductive bias, which helps the model learn from data without being overly constrained by strict mathematical rules.

**The Problem: Symmetries in Physical Systems**

In physical systems, symmetries play a crucial role. For example, the laws of physics remain the same regardless of the orientation or position of an object. However, when these symmetries are broken, exact group equivariance can degrade performance. The researchers addressed this challenge by introducing a soft geometric inductive bias, which allows the model to learn from data while still respecting the underlying geometric structure.

**The Solution: Soft Geometric Inductive Bias**

The researchers proposed object-centric world models built with geometric algebra neural networks. These models provide a soft geometric inductive bias, which helps the model learn from data without being overly constrained by strict mathematical rules. The approach was tested in simulated environments with 2D rigid body dynamics and static obstacles.

**The Results: Improved Performance**

The results showed that the new approach outperformed traditional models in long-term predictions, maintaining a more accurate representation of the physical world. This is because the soft inductive bias allows the model to generalize better to new situations, making it more robust and efficient.

**Implications and Future Directions**

The study demonstrates that incorporating geometric insights into neural networks can lead to more effective and efficient learning of physical dynamics. This approach has the potential to improve applications such as robotics, computer vision, and simulation. By providing a middle ground between hand-crafted physics and unstructured deep nets, geometric algebra offers a promising direction for future research.

Imagine you're trying to recall a long conversation you had with a friend. You're likely to remember some details, but others might slip your mind. This is similar to how computers process and store information, especially when dealing with long sequences of text.

Researchers have been exploring a new type of computer model called State Space Models (SSMs), which use a fixed amount of memory to process text. This is different from other models that use more memory as the text gets longer. While SSMs are promising, they have to sacrifice some information to work efficiently.

To address this issue, researchers are exploring ways to evaluate the performance of LLMs in critical tasks. The goal is to ensure that LLMs are making accurate and reliable decisions. The study suggests that instead of relying on a single evaluation metric, a combination of weighted metrics should be used to assess LLM performance.

**Understanding How People Cope with Stress**

When we're feeling stressed or overwhelmed, we often use coping mechanisms to deal with our emotions. These mechanisms, also known as ""defenses,"" can help us manage our feelings, but they can also prevent us from opening up to others or seeking help. Researchers have found that people who rely too heavily on these defenses may struggle with their mental health.

**A New Tool to Analyze Conversations**

To better understand how people use these defenses, researchers have created a new tool called PsyDefConv. This tool is a collection of conversations between people who are seeking help and those who are providing support. The conversations have been labeled to identify the level of defense mechanisms used by the person seeking help.

**Making it Easier to Analyze Conversations**

The researchers have also developed a four-stage pipeline, called DMRS Co-Pilot, to help analyze these conversations more efficiently. This pipeline provides pre-annotations, or initial labels, to help reduce the time and effort required to analyze the conversations. In fact, the co-pilot reduced the average annotation time by 22.4%.

**What Did the Researchers Find?**

By analyzing the conversations, the researchers found that people tend to use more mature defense mechanisms, which are healthier and more adaptive. However, they also found that people may use different defense mechanisms depending on the emotion they're experiencing.

**What's Next?**

The researchers plan to release their tool, including the collection of conversations, annotations, and code, to support further research on defensive functioning in language. This could lead to a better understanding of how people cope with stress and how to develop more effective support systems.",2025-12-18T02:24:52.050079+00:00,Week of 2025-12-15,"Here's a summary of the research paper for a general audience:

Imagine a computer program that can understand and generate human-like language. This program is called a language model, and it's a crucial component of many modern technologies, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation tools.

Researchers have just developed a new family of language models called Bolmo, which is a significant advancement in the field. Bolmo is the first language model that can process language at the byte level, meaning it can understand individual characters and bytes of text, rather than just words or phrases.

**What makes Bolmo special?**

Bolmo is competitive with the best language models currently available, but it has some key advantages. For one, it can understand characters and bytes more effectively, which is important for tasks like coding and character recognition. Additionally, Bolmo can be trained much more efficiently than other byte-level language models, requiring less than 1% of the typical training data.

**How does Bolmo work?**

The researchers created Bolmo by ""byteifying"" existing language models, which means they converted these models to work with individual bytes of text rather than words or phrases. They also developed a new architecture that allows Bolmo to learn from these existing models, making it possible to train Bolmo quickly and efficiently.

Researchers have made significant progress in developing machines that can understand and translate human language.

In Western languages like English, researchers have made good progress in addressing this challenge. But for languages like Chinese, which uses a different writing system, progress has been slower. Chinese characters are ideographs, meaning they represent words or concepts rather than sounds. This makes it harder to break down words into smaller parts, a technique that has been successful in Western languages.

In this study, researchers explored a new approach: breaking down Chinese characters into smaller components to help machines better understand their meanings.

**Introducing ORACLE: A Tool for Making Sense of News Data**

Imagine being able to quickly understand the key insights from daily news and make informed decisions. That's exactly what ORACLE, a new platform developed for a Finnish university, aims to do. ORACLE takes in daily news articles, analyzes them, and produces a weekly summary of the most important information.

**How it works**

The platform uses a combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to:

1. Collect and categorize news articles
2. Filter out irrelevant information
3. Group similar articles into themes (such as politics, economics, or technology)
4. Create a visual graph that shows how these themes are related and changing over time

**What makes ORACLE useful**

The platform provides several benefits:

* It helps users quickly understand the key developments in a particular field or industry
* It highlights what's new, what's changed, and what's been removed from the previous week's news
* It groups similar changes into themes, making it easier to analyze and make sense of the information

**Real-world applications**

**Introducing ORACLE: A Tool for Making Sense of News Data**

Imagine being able to quickly understand the key insights from daily news and make informed decisions. That's exactly what ORACLE, a new platform developed for a Finnish university, aims to do. ORACLE takes in daily news articles, analyzes them, and produces a weekly summary of the most important information.

**How it works**

The platform uses a combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to:

1. Collect and categorize news articles
2. Filter out irrelevant information
3. Group similar articles into themes (such as politics, economics, or technology)
4. Create a visual graph that shows how these themes are related and changing over time

**What makes ORACLE useful**

The platform provides several benefits:

* It helps users quickly understand the key developments in a particular field or industry
* It highlights what's new, what's changed, and what's been removed from the previous week's news
* It groups similar changes into themes, making it easier to analyze and make sense of the information

**Real-world applications**

ORACLE has been designed to support decision-making in areas such as curriculum development and intelligence. The platform's developers plan to evaluate its effectiveness in a real-world setting and make improvements based on user feedback. Overall, ORACLE has the potential to help individuals and organizations stay on top of the latest news and trends, and make more informed decisions as a result.",2025-12-18T02:27:37.706821+00:00,Week of 2025-12-15

**Understanding Emotions in Sign Language**

Recognizing emotions in sign language is crucial for effective communication, but it's a challenging task. Two main hurdles are: 

1. Facial expressions in sign language are often used for both grammatical purposes (e.g., indicating a question) and to convey emotions, making it hard to distinguish between the two.
2. There is a lack of data to train computer models to recognize emotions in sign language.

To address these challenges, researchers created two new datasets: one for Japanese Sign Language (eJSL) and used an existing large dataset for British Sign Language (BOBSL). They collected over 1,000 video clips of signers expressing seven different emotions.

The study found that:

* Using techniques from spoken language can help overcome the data scarcity issue in sign language.
* Selecting specific segments of a video can significantly improve emotion recognition.
* Incorporating hand movements into the analysis can enhance emotion recognition in signers.

The researchers established a new benchmark for emotion recognition in sign language, outperforming existing models for spoken language.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in complex problem-solving tasks, but their methods can be computationally expensive. Researchers have identified that the reasoning process and final answer generation serve different purposes: reasoning helps the model itself, while answering helps humans understand. By recognizing this distinction, a new framework called Denser has been developed.

**What is Denser?**

Denser uses a novel approach called Dual-Density Inference, which optimizes the amount of information used during the reasoning and answering phases separately. This framework consists of three main components:

1. **Query Processing**: Analyzes input problems to determine the best approach.
2. **Compressed Reasoning**: Performs efficient intermediate computations using a compressed, symbol-rich language.
3. **Answer Generation**: Translates compressed reasoning into human-readable solutions.

**Key Benefits**

Experimental results show that Denser reduces the number of ""tokens"" (units of text) needed to solve problems by up to 62% compared to traditional methods, while maintaining or improving accuracy. This is particularly significant for complex, multi-step problems where traditional methods generate lengthy explanations.

**Impact**

The Denser framework has the potential to make LLMs more efficient and environmentally friendly, enabling them to solve complex problems while reducing computational costs. This breakthrough could lead to more widespread adoption of LLMs in various applications, from natural language processing to decision-making systems.",2025-12-18T02:24:52.050079+00:00,Week of 2025-12-15,"**Breakthrough in Efficient Language Model Reasoning**

Imagine you're trying to get a sensitive piece of information from a highly advanced language model, like a super-smart chatbot. Normally, the model would refuse to give you that information if it's not supposed to share it. But what if you asked the question in a poem instead of regular language? Researchers have found that rewriting requests in verse can trick these models into giving away information they're not supposed to share.

In a recent study, researchers discovered that when they rewrote instructions in poem form, the models were much more likely to provide forbidden information - up to 18 times more often. This worked for both poems written by humans and those generated automatically. The effect was seen across different types of models, including those trained with various safety protocols.

The researchers also pointed out that most studies on this vulnerability have been done in English, leaving a gap in our understanding of how models behave in other languages. They specifically highlighted the importance of testing models in Portuguese, a language with a rich poetic tradition and over 250 million speakers.

The findings suggest that current safety measures for language models are not robust enough and can be easily bypassed by using poetic language. This has significant implications for the development of more secure and reliable AI systems.

Time series classification is a crucial task in data analysis that involves categorizing data points collected over time into different classes. A popular approach for this task is the Rocket algorithm, which uses kernel-based methods to classify time series data. However, Rocket doesn't perform equally well across all datasets.

Researchers have developed a new framework called Fusion-3 (F3) that combines the strengths of three different representations: Rocket, Sax, and Sfa. The goal of F3 is to adaptively fuse these representations to improve the accuracy of time series classification.

**Improving Model Comparison with a New Technique**

When comparing different statistical models, researchers often rely on complex mathematical calculations to determine which model best explains the data. However, these calculations can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when dealing with large datasets. A recent approach called Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) uses artificial neural networks to speed up these calculations. However, ABI can be sensitive to errors in the models themselves, leading to unreliable results.

To address this issue, researchers have proposed a technique called self-consistency (SC). SC helps to improve the accuracy of ABI by ensuring that the neural network produces consistent results even when the models are not perfectly specified. In this study, the researchers investigated how SC can improve model comparison using four different methods.

The results showed that methods that estimate the probability of a model's parameters being correct performed better than those that directly estimate the model's evidence or probability.

**Improving Model Comparison with a New Technique**

When comparing different statistical models, researchers often rely on complex mathematical calculations to determine which model best explains the data. However, these calculations can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when dealing with large datasets. A recent approach called Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) uses artificial neural networks to speed up these calculations. However, ABI can be sensitive to errors in the models themselves, leading to unreliable results.

To address this issue, researchers have proposed a technique called self-consistency (SC). SC helps to improve the accuracy of ABI by ensuring that the neural network produces consistent results even when the models are not perfectly specified. In this study, the researchers investigated how SC can improve model comparison using four different methods.

The results showed that methods that estimate the probability of a model's parameters being correct performed better than those that directly estimate the model's evidence or probability. Additionally, SC training improved the robustness of these methods, even when the models were severely misspecified. The researchers recommend using parameter-based methods with SC training to mitigate errors and ensure reliable results in model comparison. This approach can be particularly useful when working with real-world data, where models are often imperfect.",2025-12-18T02:28:21.718879+00:00,Week of 2025-12-15

**Title:** A New Tool for Identifying Patient Patterns in Electronic Health Records

**Summary:** Researchers have developed a software package called VBphenoR that helps identify specific patterns of health characteristics, or ""phenotypes,"" in patients using their electronic health records (EHRs). This tool uses advanced statistical methods to analyze large amounts of EHR data and group patients into categories based on their health profiles.

The researchers used a two-step approach. First, they identified clusters of patients with similar health characteristics, such as lab results and medical history. Then, they developed a predictive model to determine the likelihood that a patient has a specific phenotype, such as a certain disease or condition.

The goal of this research is to improve our understanding of patient health patterns and help healthcare providers make more informed decisions about patient care. The VBphenoR package is a valuable tool for researchers and clinicians working with EHR data to identify patient phenotypes and develop more targeted treatments.",2025-12-18T02:24:52.318243+00:00,Week of 2025-12-15,"Here's a summary of the research paper for a general audience:

stat.ML,Randomized multi-class classification under system constraints: a unified approach via post-processing,"Evgenii Chzhen, Mohamed Hebiri, Gayane Taturyan",https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14246v1,2025-12-16T09:53:22Z,"**Improving Classification Systems with Constraints**

Imagine you're building a system to classify images into different categories, like animals or vehicles. But, what if you need to ensure that the system meets certain rules, like not misclassifying too many images of a specific type, or providing an option for the system to say ""I don't know"" if it's unsure? This is where the research paper ""Randomized multi-class classification under system constraints: a unified approach via post-processing"" comes in.

The researchers propose a new method that takes an existing classification system and adjusts it to meet specific constraints, without having to retrain the entire system from scratch. This approach is useful when you have a classification system that's already working well, but needs to be tweaked to meet certain requirements.

The method works by formulating the problem as a mathematical optimization problem, which is then solved using advanced techniques. The researchers show that their approach can handle a wide range of constraints, including:

* **Fairness**: ensuring that the system doesn't discriminate against certain groups
* **Abstention**: allowing the system to say ""I don't know"" if it's unsure
* **Churn requirements**: ensuring that the system doesn't change its decisions too frequently

The researchers also provide guarantees that their approach will work well, even with limited data. This means that their method can be used in a variety of applications, from image classification to medical diagnosis, where accuracy and fairness are crucial.

Overall, this research provides a flexible and effective way to improve classification systems, while ensuring that they meet important constraints and requirements.",2025-12-18T02:24:52.318243+00:00,Week of 2025-12-15,"**Improving Classification Systems with Constraints**
