cs.LG,VDC-Agent: When Video Detailed Captioners Evolve Themselves via Agentic Self-Reflection,"Qiang Wang, Xinyuan Gao, SongLin Dong, Jizhou Han, Jiangyang Li, Yuhang He, Yihong Gong",https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19436v1,2025-11-24T18:59:56Z,"We present VDC-Agent, a self-evolving framework for Video Detailed Captioning that requires neither human annotations nor larger teacher models. The agent forms a closed loop of caption generation, principle-guided scoring (score and textual suggestions), and prompt refinement. When caption quality regresses, a self-reflection path leverages the previous chain-of-thought to amend the update. Running this process on unlabeled videos produces trajectories of (caption, score) pairs. We convert the trajectories into preference tuples and filter out samples with JSON parsing errors, resulting in VDC-Agent-19K, which contains 18,886 automatically constructed pairs. We then fine-tune the base MLLM on this dataset using an easy-to-hard curriculum direct preference optimization. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, our VDC-Agent-7B attains state-of-the-art performance on the VDC benchmark with 49.08% average accuracy and 2.50 score, surpassing specialized video captioners and improving over the base model by +5.13% accuracy and +0.27 score at similar inference cost.",2025-11-25T13:31:44.358507+05:30,Week of 2025-11-24
cs.LG,Breaking the Likelihood-Quality Trade-off in Diffusion Models by Merging Pretrained Experts,"Yasin Esfandiari, Stefan Bauer, Sebastian U. Stich, Andrea Dittadi",https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19434v1,2025-11-24T18:59:53Z,"Diffusion models for image generation often exhibit a trade-off between perceptual sample quality and data likelihood: training objectives emphasizing high-noise denoising steps yield realistic images but poor likelihoods, whereas likelihood-oriented training overweights low-noise steps and harms visual fidelity. We introduce a simple plug-and-play sampling method that combines two pretrained diffusion experts by switching between them along the denoising trajectory. Specifically, we apply an image-quality expert at high noise levels to shape global structure, then switch to a likelihood expert at low noise levels to refine pixel statistics. The approach requires no retraining or fine-tuning -- only the choice of an intermediate switching step. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet32, the merged model consistently matches or outperforms its base components, improving or preserving both likelihood and sample quality relative to each expert alone. These results demonstrate that expert switching across noise levels is an effective way to break the likelihood-quality trade-off in image diffusion models.",2025-11-25T13:31:44.358507+05:30,Week of 2025-11-24
cs.LG,Flow Map Distillation Without Data,"Shangyuan Tong, Nanye Ma, Saining Xie, Tommi Jaakkola",https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19428v1,2025-11-24T18:58:55Z,"State-of-the-art flow models achieve remarkable quality but require slow, iterative sampling. To accelerate this, flow maps can be distilled from pre-trained teachers, a procedure that conventionally requires sampling from an external dataset. We argue that this data-dependency introduces a fundamental risk of Teacher-Data Mismatch, as a static dataset may provide an incomplete or even misaligned representation of the teacher's full generative capabilities. This leads us to question whether this reliance on data is truly necessary for successful flow map distillation. In this work, we explore a data-free alternative that samples only from the prior distribution, a distribution the teacher is guaranteed to follow by construction, thereby circumventing the mismatch risk entirely. To demonstrate the practical viability of this philosophy, we introduce a principled framework that learns to predict the teacher's sampling path while actively correcting for its own compounding errors to ensure high fidelity. Our approach surpasses all data-based counterparts and establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin. Specifically, distilling from SiT-XL/2+REPA, our method reaches an impressive FID of 1.45 on ImageNet 256x256, and 1.49 on ImageNet 512x512, both with only 1 sampling step. We hope our work establishes a more robust paradigm for accelerating generative models and motivates the broader adoption of flow map distillation without data.",2025-11-25T13:31:44.358507+05:30,Week of 2025-11-24

This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through continuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence.",2025-11-25T13:31:44.358507+05:30,Week of 2025-11-24

Huang, Sheng Zhang, Qianchu Liu, Guanghui Qin, Tinghui Zhu, Tristan Naumann, Muhao Chen, Hoifung Poon",https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19417v1,2025-11-24T18:55:16Z,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in challenging, knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks. However, extending LLMs to perceive and reason over a new modality (e.g., vision), often requires costly development of large-scale vision language models (VLMs) with LLMs as backbones. Smaller VLMs are more efficient and adaptable but often lack the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs. In this work, we propose BeMyEyes, a modular, multi-agent framework for extending LLMs to multimodal reasoning by orchestrating collaboration between efficient, adaptable VLMs as perceivers and powerful LLMs as reasoners through conversations. We then introduce a data synthesis and supervised fine-tuning pipeline to train the perceiver agent to effectively collaborate with the reasoner agent. By combining the complementary strengths of perception and reasoning agents, BeMyEyes avoids the need for training large-scale multimodal models, preserves the generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and allows flexible extension to new domains and modalities. Experiments show that our framework unlocks the multimodal reasoning capabilities for LLMs, enabling a lightweight and fully open-source solution, i.e. equipping text-only DeepSeek-R1 with Qwen2.5-VL-7B perceiver, to outperform large-scale proprietary VLMs such as GPT-4o on a wide range of knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.

However, UMMs still exhibit a fundamental inconsistency: understanding favors compact embeddings, whereas generation favors reconstruction-rich representations. This structural trade-off produces misaligned decision boundaries, degraded cross-modal coherence, and heightened vulnerability under distributional and adversarial shifts. In this paper, we present UniGame, a self-adversarial post-training framework that directly targets the inconsistencies. By applying a lightweight perturber at the shared token interface, UniGame enables the generation branch to actively seek and challenge fragile understanding, turning the model itself into its own adversary. Experiments demonstrate that UniGame significantly improves the consistency (+4.6%). Moreover, it also achieves substantial improvements in understanding (+3.6%), generation (+0.02), out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness (+4.8% and +6.2% on NaturalBench and AdVQA). The framework is architecture-agnostic, introduces less than 1% additional parameters, and is complementary to existing post-training methods. These results position adversarial self-play as a general and effective principle for enhancing the coherence, stability, and unified competence of future multimodal foundation models.

These multi-agent interactions pose a fundamental challenge, particularly in social dilemmas, where agents' individual incentives can undermine collective welfare. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been effective for aligning large language models (LLMs) in the single-agent regime, prior small-network results suggest that standard RL in multi-agent settings often converges to defecting, self-interested policies. We show the same effect in LLMs: despite cooperative priors, RL-trained LLM agents develop opportunistic behavior that can exploit even advanced closed-source models. To address this tendency of RL to converge to poor equilibria, we adapt a recent opponent-learning awareness algorithm, Advantage Alignment, to fine-tune LLMs toward multi-agent cooperation and non-exploitability. We then introduce a group-relative baseline that simplifies advantage computation in iterated games, enabling multi-agent training at LLM scale. We also contribute a novel social dilemma environment, Trust and Split, which requires natural language communication to achieve high collective welfare. Across a wide range of social dilemmas, policies learned with Advantage Alignment achieve higher collective payoffs while remaining robust against exploitation by greedy agents.",2025-11-25T13:31:44.358507+05:30,Week of 2025-11-24

Compared with standard nonparametric instrumental variable regression (NPIV), the additional observed covariates facilitate causal identification and enables heterogeneous causal effect estimation. However, the presence of observed covariates introduces two challenges for its theoretical analysis. First, it induces a partial identity structure, which renders previous NPIV analyses - based on measures of ill-posedness, stability conditions, or link conditions - inapplicable. Second, it imposes anisotropic smoothness on the structural function. To address the first challenge, we introduce a novel Fourier measure of partial smoothing; for the second challenge, we extend the existing kernel 2SLS instrumental variable algorithm with observed covariates, termed KIV-O, to incorporate Gaussian kernel lengthscales adaptive to the anisotropic smoothness. We prove upper $L^2$-learning rates for KIV-O and the first $L^2$-minimax lower learning rates for NPIV-O. Both rates interpolate between known optimal rates of NPIV and nonparametric regression (NPR). Interestingly, we identify a gap between our upper and lower bounds, which arises from the choice of kernel lengthscales tuned to minimize a projected risk. Our theoretical analysis also applies to proximal causal inference, an emerging framework for causal effect estimation that shares the same conditional moment restriction as NPIV-O.",2025-11-25T13:31:44.358507+05:30,Week of 2025-11-24

We address this with Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER), in which we construct and maintain rubrics that co-evolve with the policy model during training; this allows the rubrics to incorporate information that the model has newly explored and to provide discriminative, on-policy feedback. Using RLER, we develop Deep Research Tulu (DR Tulu-8B), the first open model that is directly trained for open-ended, long-form deep research. Across four long-form deep research benchmarks in science, healthcare and general domains, DR Tulu substantially outperforms existing open deep research models, and matches or exceeds proprietary deep research systems, while being significantly smaller and cheaper per query.

Kane, Sihan Liu, Thanasis Pittas",https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19398v1,2025-11-24T18:35:29Z,"This work studies information-computation gaps for statistical problems. A common approach for providing evidence of such gaps is to show sample complexity lower bounds (that are stronger than the information-theoretic optimum) against natural models of computation. A popular such model in the literature is the family of low-degree polynomial tests. While these tests are defined in such a way that make them easy to analyze, the class of algorithms that they rule out is somewhat restricted. An important goal in this context has been to obtain lower bounds against the stronger and more natural class of low-degree Polynomial Threshold Function (PTF) tests, i.e., any test that can be expressed as comparing some low-degree polynomial of the data to a threshold. Proving lower bounds against PTF tests has turned out to be challenging. Indeed, we are not aware of any non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds in the literature.   In this paper, we establish the first non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds for a range of statistical tasks. Specifically, we prove a near-optimal PTF testing lower bound for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA). Our NGCA lower bound implies similar lower bounds for a number of other statistical problems. Our proof leverages a connection to recent work on pseudorandom generators for PTFs and recent techniques developed in that context. At the technical level, we develop several tools of independent interest, including novel structural results for analyzing the behavior of low-degree polynomials restricted to random directions.",2025-11-25T13:31:44.358507+05:30,Week of 2025-11-24

However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun's surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of partially observable, long-memory dynamical systems, with applications to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost. When integrated into a diffusion model, we show that our inference scheme significantly reduces the bias of the predicted distributions and improves rollout stability.",2025-11-25T13:31:44.358507+05:30,Week of 2025-11-24

This study presents a rigorous comparative analysis of DDPMs against the emerging Flow Matching (Rectified Flow) paradigm, specifically isolating their geometric and efficiency properties on low-resource hardware. By implementing both frameworks on a shared Time-Conditioned U-Net backbone using the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that Flow Matching significantly outperforms Diffusion in efficiency. Our geometric analysis reveals that Flow Matching learns a highly rectified transport path (Curvature $\mathcal{C} \approx 1.02$), which is near-optimal, whereas Diffusion trajectories remain stochastic and tortuous ($\mathcal{C} \approx 3.45$). Furthermore, we establish an ``efficiency frontier'' at $N=10$ function evaluations, where Flow Matching retains high fidelity while Diffusion collapses. Finally, we show via numerical sensitivity analysis that the learned vector field is sufficiently linear to render high-order ODE solvers (Runge-Kutta 4) unnecessary, validating the use of lightweight Euler solvers for edge deployment. \textbf{This work concludes that Flow Matching is the superior algorithmic choice for real-time, resource-constrained generative tasks.}",2025-11-25T13:31:44.358507+05:30,Week of 2025-11-24

In this paper, we propose RELED, a scalable MARL framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-driven expert demonstrations with autonomous agent exploration. RELED incorporates a Stationarity-Aware Expert Demonstration module, which leverages theoretical non-stationarity bounds to enhance the quality of LLM-generated expert trajectories, thus providing high reward and training-stable samples for each agent. Moreover, a Hybrid Expert-Agent Policy Optimization module adaptively balances each agent's learning from both expert-generated and agent-generated trajectories, accelerating policy convergence and improving generalization.

In experimental sciences, they are increasingly used to automate experimental design, often via combinatorial search and optimization. However, as the setups grow more complex, the computational cost of traditional, CPU-based simulators becomes a major limitation. Here, we show how neural surrogate models can significantly reduce reliance on such slow simulators while preserving accuracy. Taking the design of interferometric gravitational wave detectors as a representative example, we train a neural network to surrogate the gravitational wave physics simulator Finesse, which was developed by the LIGO community. Despite that small changes in physical parameters can change the output by orders of magnitudes, the model rapidly predicts the quality and feasibility of candidate designs, allowing an efficient exploration of large design spaces. Our algorithm loops between training the surrogate, inverse designing new experiments, and verifying their properties with the slow simulator for further training. Assisted by auto-differentiation and GPU parallelism, our method proposes high-quality experiments much faster than direct optimization. Solutions that our algorithm finds within hours outperform designs that take five days for the optimizer to reach.

Instead of predicting a single class, CP generates a prediction set, guaranteed to include the true label with a pre-specified probability. The performance of different CP methods is typically assessed by their average prediction set size. In setups where the classes can be partitioned into semantic groups, e.g., diseases that require similar treatment, users can benefit from prediction sets that are not only small on average, but also contain a small number of semantically different groups. This paper begins by addressing this problem and ultimately offers a widely applicable tool for boosting any CP method on any dataset. First, given a class partition, we propose augmenting the CP score function with a term that penalizes predictions with out-of-group errors. We theoretically analyze this strategy and prove its advantages for group-related metrics. Surprisingly, we show mathematically that, for common class partitions, it can also reduce the average set size of any CP score function. Our analysis reveals the class similarity factors behind this improvement and motivates us to propose a model-specific variant, which does not require any human semantic partition and can further reduce the prediction set size. Finally, we present an extensive empirical study, encompassing prominent CP methods, multiple models, and several datasets, which demonstrates that our class-similarity-based approach consistently enhances CP methods.",2025-11-25T13:31:44.358507+05:30,Week of 2025-11-24

Previous work and recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automating the generation of reward functions. However, existing methodologies often require preliminary evaluation metrics, human-engineered feedback for the refinement process, or the use of environmental source code as context. To address these limitations, this paper introduces LEARN-Opt (LLM-based Evaluator and Analyzer for Reward functioN Optimization). This LLM-based, fully autonomous, and model-agnostic framework eliminates the need for preliminary metrics and environmental source code as context to generate, execute, and evaluate reward function candidates from textual descriptions of systems and task objectives. LEARN-Opt's main contribution lies in its ability to autonomously derive performance metrics directly from the system description and the task objective, enabling unsupervised evaluation and selection of reward functions. Our experiments indicate that LEARN-Opt achieves performance comparable to or better to that of state-of-the-art methods, such as EUREKA, while requiring less prior knowledge. We find that automated reward design is a high-variance problem, where the average-case candidate fails, requiring a multi-run approach to find the best candidates. Finally, we show that LEARN-Opt can unlock the potential of low-cost LLMs to find high-performing candidates that are comparable to, or even better than, those of larger models. This demonstrated performance affirms its potential to generate high-quality reward functions without requiring any preliminary human-defined metrics, thereby reducing engineering overhead and enhancing generalizability.",2025-11-25T13:31:44.358507+05:30,Week of 2025-11-24

This sampling approach enables our estimator to efficiently scale to large datasets without sacrificing reliability. To support intrinsic evaluation of cluster quality without ground-truth labels, we propose the Cohesion Ratio, a simple and interpretable evaluation metric that quantifies how much intra-cluster similarity exceeds the global similarity background. It has an information-theoretic motivation inspired by mutual information, and in our experiments it correlates closely with extrinsic measures such as normalized mutual information and homogeneity. Extensive experiments on six short-text datasets and four modern embedding models show that standard algorithms like K-Means and HAC, when guided by our estimator, significantly outperform popular parameter-light methods such as HDBSCAN, OPTICS, and Leiden. These results demonstrate the practical value of our spectral estimator and Cohesion Ratio for unsupervised organization and evaluation of short text data.

In this work, we introduce a quantitative confidence metric to assess the agreement between predictions and experimental observations, providing a quantitative measure of the confidence of machine learning models trained on either DFT or CALPHAD input in accounting for experimental evidence.

Agreement between the observed and predicted phases was evaluated using either temperature-independent phase classification or a model that incorporates a temperature-dependent probability of phase formation.

Our empirical study reveals an inherent trade-off: longer horizons provide stronger global foresight but degrade fine-grained accuracy, while shorter ones sharpen local control yet struggle on long-term tasks, implying fixed choice of single horizons being suboptimal. To mitigate the trade-off, we propose a $\textbf{mixture of horizons (MoH)}$ strategy. MoH rearranges the action chunk into several segments with different horizons, processes them in parallel with a shared action transformer, and fuses outputs with a light linear gate. It has three appealing benefits. 1) MoH exploits long-term foresight and short-term precision jointly within a single model, improving both performance and generalizability to complex tasks. 2) MoH is plug-and-play for full-attention action modules with minimal training or inference overhead. 3) MoH enables dynamic inference with adaptive horizons, which selects stable actions through cross-horizon consensus, achieving 2.5$\times$ higher throughput than baselines while preserving superior performance. Extensive experiments over flow-based policies $π_0$, $π_{0.5}$, and one-step regression policy $π_{\text{reg}}$ demonstrate that MoH yields consistent and significant gains on both simulations and real-world tasks.

This leads us to question whether this reliance on data is truly necessary for successful flow map distillation. In this work, we explore a data-free alternative that samples only from the prior distribution, a distribution the teacher is guaranteed to follow by construction, thereby circumventing the mismatch risk entirely. To demonstrate the practical viability of this philosophy, we introduce a principled framework that learns to predict the teacher's sampling path while actively correcting for its own compounding errors to ensure high fidelity. Our approach surpasses all data-based counterparts and establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin.

Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence.",2025-11-25T13:31:45.216458+05:30,Week of 2025-11-24

We propose a medically grounded hybrid pipeline that performs staging by explicitly measuring the tumor's size and distance properties rather than treating it as a pure image classification task. Our method employs specialized encoder-decoder networks to precisely segment the lung and adjacent anatomy, including the lobes, tumor, mediastinum, and diaphragm. Subsequently, we extract the necessary tumor properties, i.e. measure the largest tumor dimension and calculate the distance between the tumor and neighboring anatomical structures by a quantitative analysis of the segmentation masks.

Manual counting is labor-intensive and error-prone, motivating automation through deep learning techniques. However, training reliable deep learning models requires large amounts of high-quality annotated data, which is difficult and time-consuming to produce manually. Consequently, existing cell-counting datasets are often limited, frequently containing fewer than $500$ images. In this work, we introduce a large-scale annotated dataset comprising $3{,}023$ images from immunocytochemistry experiments related to cellular differentiation, containing over $430{,}000$ manually annotated cell locations. The dataset presents significant challenges: high cell density, overlapping and morphologically diverse cells, a long-tailed distribution of cell count per image, and variation in staining protocols. We benchmark three categories of existing methods: regression-based, crowd-counting, and cell-counting techniques on a test set with cell counts ranging from $10$ to $2{,}126$ cells per image. We also evaluate how the Segment Anything Model (SAM) can be adapted for microscopy cell counting using only dot-annotated datasets. As a case study, we implement a density-map-based adaptation of SAM (SAM-Counter) and report a mean absolute error (MAE) of $22.12$, which outperforms existing approaches (second-best MAE of $27.46$).

Our empirical study reveals an inherent trade-off: longer horizons provide stronger global foresight but degrade fine-grained accuracy, while shorter ones sharpen local control yet struggle on long-term tasks, implying fixed choice of single horizons being suboptimal. To mitigate the trade-off, we propose a $\textbf{mixture of horizons (MoH)}$ strategy. MoH rearranges the action chunk into several segments with different horizons, processes them in parallel with a shared action transformer, and fuses outputs with a light linear gate. It has three appealing benefits. 1) MoH exploits long-term foresight and short-term precision jointly within a single model, improving both performance and generalizability to complex tasks. 2) MoH is plug-and-play for full-attention action modules with minimal training or inference overhead. 3) MoH enables dynamic inference with adaptive horizons, which selects stable actions through cross-horizon consensus, achieving 2.5$\times$ higher throughput than baselines while preserving superior performance. Extensive experiments over flow-based policies $π_0$, $π_{0.5}$, and one-step regression policy $π_{\text{reg}}$ demonstrate that MoH yields consistent and significant gains on both simulations and real-world tasks. Notably, under mixed-task setting, $π_{0.5}$ with MoH reaches a new state-of-the-art with 99$\%$ average success rate on LIBERO after only $30k$ training iterations.

To address this limitation, we introduce Semantic Engineering, a lightweight method for enriching program semantics so that LLM-based systems can more accurately reflect developer intent without requiring full manual prompt design. We present Semantic Context Annotations (SemTexts), a language-level mechanism that allows developers to embed natural-language context directly into program constructs. Integrated into the Jac programming language, Semantic Engineering extends MTP to incorporate these enriched semantics during prompt generation.

We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through continuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence.",2025-11-25T13:31:46.076387+05:30,Week of 2025-11-24

Smaller VLMs are more efficient and adaptable but often lack the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs. In this work, we propose BeMyEyes, a modular, multi-agent framework for extending LLMs to multimodal reasoning by orchestrating collaboration between efficient, adaptable VLMs as perceivers and powerful LLMs as reasoners through conversations.

In this paper, we present UniGame, a self-adversarial post-training framework that directly targets the inconsistencies.

However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun's surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of partially observable, long-memory dynamical systems, with applications to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost.

However, it remains challenging for end-to-end deep learning approaches, as such approaches often overlook spatial and anatomical information that are central to the tumor-node-metastasis system. The tumor stage depends on multiple quantitative criteria, including the tumor size and its proximity to the nearest anatomical structures, and small variations can alter the staging outcome. We propose a medically grounded hybrid pipeline that performs staging by explicitly measuring the tumor's size and distance properties rather than treating it as a pure image classification task. Our method employs specialized encoder-decoder networks to precisely segment the lung and adjacent anatomy, including the lobes, tumor, mediastinum, and diaphragm. Subsequently, we extract the necessary tumor properties, i.e. measure the largest tumor dimension and calculate the distance between the tumor and neighboring anatomical structures by a quantitative analysis of the segmentation masks.

This LLM-based, fully autonomous, and model-agnostic framework eliminates the need for preliminary metrics and environmental source code as context to generate, execute, and evaluate reward function candidates from textual descriptions of systems and task objectives. LEARN-Opt's main contribution lies in its ability to autonomously derive performance metrics directly from the system description and the task objective, enabling unsupervised evaluation and selection of reward functions.

This study evaluates recent mLLMs and fine-tuned variants across several generative expansion strategies to identify factors that drive cross-lingual retrieval performance. Results show that query length largely determines which prompting technique is effective, and that more elaborate prompts often do not yield further gains. Substantial linguistic disparities persist: cross-lingual query expansion can produce the largest improvements for languages with the weakest baselines, yet retrieval is especially poor between languages written in different scripts.

However, current methods lack a unified evaluation framework. To address this, this paper establishes a general threat model and introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing Universality, Transmissibility, and Robustness. Experiments show that existing methods perform well in universality and transmissibility, and exhibit some robustness against common image processing operations, yet still fall short under real-world threat scenarios.

To address these limitations, we introduce PRInTS, a generative PRM trained with dual capabilities: (1) dense scoring based on the PRM's reasoning across multiple step quality dimensions (e.g., interpretation of tool outputs, tool call informativeness) and (2) trajectory summarization that compresses the growing context while preserving essential information for step evaluation.

However, extending LLMs to perceive and reason over a new modality (e.g., vision), often requires costly development of large-scale vision language models (VLMs) with LLMs as backbones. Smaller VLMs are more efficient and adaptable but often lack the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs. In this work, we propose BeMyEyes, a modular, multi-agent framework for extending LLMs to multimodal reasoning by orchestrating collaboration between efficient, adaptable VLMs as perceivers and powerful LLMs as reasoners through conversations. We then introduce a data synthesis and supervised fine-tuning pipeline to train the perceiver agent to effectively collaborate with the reasoner agent. By combining the complementary strengths of perception and reasoning agents, BeMyEyes avoids the need for training large-scale multimodal models, preserves the generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and allows flexible extension to new domains and modalities. Experiments show that our framework unlocks the multimodal reasoning capabilities for LLMs, enabling a lightweight and fully open-source solution, i.e. equipping text-only DeepSeek-R1 with Qwen2.5-VL-7B perceiver, to outperform large-scale proprietary VLMs such as GPT-4o on a wide range of knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.

This sampling approach enables our estimator to efficiently scale to large datasets without sacrificing reliability. To support intrinsic evaluation of cluster quality without ground-truth labels, we propose the Cohesion Ratio, a simple and interpretable evaluation metric that quantifies how much intra-cluster similarity exceeds the global similarity background. It has an information-theoretic motivation inspired by mutual information, and in our experiments it correlates closely with extrinsic measures such as normalized mutual information and homogeneity. Extensive experiments on six short-text datasets and four modern embedding models show that standard algorithms like K-Means and HAC, when guided by our estimator, significantly outperform popular parameter-light methods such as HDBSCAN, OPTICS, and Leiden. These results demonstrate the practical value of our spectral estimator and Cohesion Ratio for unsupervised organization and evaluation of short text data.

Recently, multilingual large language models (mLLMs) have shifted query expansion from semantic augmentation with synonyms and related words to pseudo-document generation. Pseudo-documents both introduce additional relevant terms and bridge the gap between short queries and long documents, which is particularly beneficial in dense retrieval. This study evaluates recent mLLMs and fine-tuned variants across several generative expansion strategies to identify factors that drive cross-lingual retrieval performance. Results show that query length largely determines which prompting technique is effective, and that more elaborate prompts often do not yield further gains. Substantial linguistic disparities persist: cross-lingual query expansion can produce the largest improvements for languages with the weakest baselines, yet retrieval is especially poor between languages written in different scripts.

We find that dense retrieval models trained specifically for CLIR consistently outperform lexical matching methods and derive little benefit from document translation.

In contrast, existing agents typically demonstrate improvements via self-evolving within a single domain, implicitly assuming a fixed environment distribution. Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MapFormers, new architectures based on Transformer models, which can learn cognitive maps from observational data and perform path integration in parallel, in a self-supervised manner. Cognitive maps are learned in the model by disentangling structural relationships in the inputs from their specific content, a property that can be achieved naturally by updating the positional encoding in Transformers with input-dependent matrices. We developed two variants of MapFormers that unify absolute and relative positional encoding to model episodic (EM) and working memory (WM), respectively. We tested MapFormers on several tasks, including a classic 2D navigation task, showing that our models can learn a cognitive map of the underlying space and generalize OOD (e.g., to longer sequences) with near-perfect performance, unlike current architectures. Together, these results demonstrate the superiority of models designed to learn a cognitive map, and the importance of introducing a structural bias for structure-content disentanglement, which can be achieved in Transformers with input-dependent positional encoding.

First, we conducted a per-layer detection using a linear probe.

However, its accuracy sharply increased in the middle blocks, reaching a peak just before the top layers. Second, we examined the effective dimensionality of the encoded violation.

However, it remains unclear how stably LLMs encode distinctions between true, false, and neither-true-nor-false content in their internal probabilistic representations. We introduce representational stability as the robustness of an LLM's veracity representations to perturbations in the operational definition of truth. We assess representational stability by (i) training a linear probe on an LLM's activations to separate true from not-true statements and (ii) measuring how its learned decision boundary shifts under controlled label changes. Using activations from sixteen open-source models and three factual domains, we compare two types of neither statements. The first are fact-like assertions about entities we believe to be absent from any training data. We call these unfamiliar neither statements. The second are nonfactual claims drawn from well-known fictional contexts. We call these familiar neither statements. The unfamiliar statements induce the largest boundary shifts, producing up to $40\%$ flipped truth judgements in fragile domains (such as word definitions), while familiar fictional statements remain more coherently clustered and yield smaller changes ($\leq 8.2\%$). These results suggest that representational stability stems more from epistemic familiarity than from linguistic form.

The pipeline combines a YOLO-based detector for multi-garment localization, k-means clustering for dominant color extraction, and a CLIP-FAISS retrieval module for fabric and gender attribute inference based on a structured product index.

Prior work capitalizes on information theory to formalize these notions; however, these studies generally rely on two simplifications: (i) optimal listeners, and (ii) universal communicative need across languages. Here, we address these limitations by introducing an information-theoretic framework for discrete object naming systems, and we use it to prove that an optimal trade-off is achievable if and only if the listener's decoder is equivalent to the Bayesian decoder of the speaker. Adopting a referential game setup from emergent communication, and focusing on the semantic domain of kinship, we show that our notion of optimality is not only theoretically achievable but also emerges empirically in learned communication systems.",2025-11-25T13:31:46.999201+05:30,Week of 2025-11-24

We introduce a simple plug-and-play sampling method that combines two pretrained diffusion experts by switching between them along the denoising trajectory. Specifically, we apply an image-quality expert at high noise levels to shape global structure, then switch to a likelihood expert at low noise levels to refine pixel statistics. The approach requires no retraining or fine-tuning -- only the choice of an intermediate switching step. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet32, the merged model consistently matches or outperforms its base components, improving or preserving both likelihood and sample quality relative to each expert alone. These results demonstrate that expert switching across noise levels is an effective way to break the likelihood-quality trade-off in image diffusion models.",2025-11-25T13:31:47.824850+05:30,Week of 2025-11-24

Compared with standard nonparametric instrumental variable regression (NPIV), the additional observed covariates facilitate causal identification and enables heterogeneous causal effect estimation. However, the presence of observed covariates introduces two challenges for its theoretical analysis. First, it induces a partial identity structure, which renders previous NPIV analyses - based on measures of ill-posedness, stability conditions, or link conditions - inapplicable. Second, it imposes anisotropic smoothness on the structural function. To address the first challenge, we introduce a novel Fourier measure of partial smoothing; for the second challenge, we extend the existing kernel 2SLS instrumental variable algorithm with observed covariates, termed KIV-O, to incorporate Gaussian kernel lengthscales adaptive to the anisotropic smoothness. We prove upper $L^2$-learning rates for KIV-O and the first $L^2$-minimax lower learning rates for NPIV-O. Both rates interpolate between known optimal rates of NPIV and nonparametric regression (NPR). Interestingly, we identify a gap between our upper and lower bounds, which arises from the choice of kernel lengthscales tuned to minimize a projected risk. Our theoretical analysis also applies to proximal causal inference, an emerging framework for causal effect estimation that shares the same conditional moment restriction as NPIV-O.",2025-11-25T13:31:47.824850+05:30,Week of 2025-11-24

A common approach for providing evidence of such gaps is to show sample complexity lower bounds (that are stronger than the information-theoretic optimum) against natural models of computation. A popular such model in the literature is the family of low-degree polynomial tests. While these tests are defined in such a way that make them easy to analyze, the class of algorithms that they rule out is somewhat restricted. An important goal in this context has been to obtain lower bounds against the stronger and more natural class of low-degree Polynomial Threshold Function (PTF) tests, i.e., any test that can be expressed as comparing some low-degree polynomial of the data to a threshold. Proving lower bounds against PTF tests has turned out to be challenging. Indeed, we are not aware of any non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds in the literature.   In this paper, we establish the first non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds for a range of statistical tasks. Specifically, we prove a near-optimal PTF testing lower bound for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA). Our NGCA lower bound implies similar lower bounds for a number of other statistical problems. Our proof leverages a connection to recent work on pseudorandom generators for PTFs and recent techniques developed in that context.

However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun's surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of partially observable, long-memory dynamical systems, with applications to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost. When integrated into a diffusion model, we show that our inference scheme significantly reduces the bias of the predicted distributions and improves rollout stability.",2025-11-25T13:31:47.824850+05:30,Week of 2025-11-24

We propose local entropy search (LES), a Bayesian optimization paradigm that explicitly targets the solutions reachable by the descent sequences of iterative optimizers. The algorithm propagates the posterior belief over the objective through the optimizer, resulting in a probability distribution over descent sequences. It then selects the next evaluation by maximizing mutual information with that distribution, using a combination of analytic entropy calculations and Monte-Carlo sampling of descent sequences.

It is known that MDMs effectively train to decode tokens in a random order, and that this ordering has significant performance implications in practice. This observation raises a fundamental question: can we design a training framework that optimizes for a favorable decoding order? We answer this in the affirmative, showing that the continuous-time variational objective of MDMs, when equipped with multivariate noise schedules, can identify and optimize for a decoding order during training. We establish a direct correspondence between decoding order and the multivariate noise schedule and show that this setting breaks invariance of the MDM objective to the noise schedule. Furthermore, we prove that the MDM objective decomposes precisely into a weighted auto-regressive losses over these orders, which establishes them as auto-regressive models with learnable orders.",2025-11-25T13:31:47.824850+05:30,Week of 2025-11-24

We also show that our ReLU-based maximum score (RMS) estimator can be generalized to an umbrella framework defined by multi-index single-crossing (MISC) conditions, while the original maximum score estimator cannot be applied. We establish the $n^{-s/(2s+1)}$ convergence rate and asymptotic normality for the RMS estimator under order-$s$ Holder smoothness.

Choosing such a cost is particularly challenging when datasets live in heterogeneous spaces, often motivating practitioners to adopt Gromov-Wasserstein formulations. To address this challenge, we introduce cost-regularized unbalanced optimal transport (CR-UOT), a framework that allows the ground cost to vary while allowing mass creation and removal. We show that CR-UOT incorporates unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein type problems through families of inner-product costs parameterized by linear transformations, enabling the matching of measures or point clouds across Euclidean spaces. We develop algorithms for such CR-UOT problems using entropic regularization and demonstrate that this approach improves the alignment of heterogeneous single-cell omics profiles, especially when many cells lack direct matches.",2025-11-25T13:31:47.824850+05:30,Week of 2025-11-24

However, the Classification EM (CEM) algorithm, a classifying version, offers a fast convergence solution while dimensionality reduction still remains a challenge.

In this work, we challenge that perspective by showing that differential privacy can be integrated into a fairness-enhancing pipeline with minimal impact on fairness guarantees. We design a postprocessing algorithm, called DP2DP, that enforces both demographic parity and differential privacy. Our analysis reveals that our algorithm converges towards its demographic parity objective at essentially the same rate (up logarithmic factor) as the best non-private methods from the literature.

The proposed pTU measures the uncertainty in the interaction between the model and the inputs. It provides insights from the model perspective: if two samples interact with a model in a similar way, then they are considered identically distributed. We also show that the pTU is insensitive to the model architecture. As an application, pTU is used to solve the out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, which is critical to ensure model reliability. Failure to detect OOD input can lead to incorrect and unreliable predictions. To address this issue, we propose a significance test for OOD based on the pTU, providing a statistical framework for this issue.

Using these two pseudo-labeled datasets, we then refit the black-box procedure twice to obtain two corresponding wild predictors. Finally, leveraging the original predictor, the two wild predictors, and the constructed wild responses, we derive an efficient excess risk upper bound.

To address this issue, we propose a unified framework, SC-SSL, which suppresses model bias through decoupled sampling control. During training, we identify the key variables for sampling control under ideal conditions. By introducing a classifier with explicit expansion capability and adaptively adjusting sampling probabilities across different data distributions, SC-SSL mitigates feature-level imbalance for minority classes.

A classical manifestation is that sample averages of arm rewards under bandit sampling may fail to satisfy a central limit theorem. Lai and Wei's stability condition provides a sufficient, and essentially necessary criterion, for asymptotic normality in bandit problems. While the celebrated Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm satisfies this stability condition, it is not minimax optimal, raising the question of whether minimax optimality and statistical stability can be achieved simultaneously. In this paper, we analyze the stability properties of a broad class of bandit algorithms that are based on the optimism principle. We establish general structural conditions under which such algorithms violate the Lai-Wei stability criterion.

This study introduces a problem-oriented framework that reinterprets existing metrics based on the specific evaluation challenges they are designed to address, rather than their mathematical forms or output structures. We categorize over twenty commonly used metrics into six dimensions: 1) basic accuracy-driven evaluation; 2) timeliness-aware reward mechanisms; 3) tolerance to labeling imprecision; 4) penalties reflecting human-audit cost; 5) robustness against random or inflated scores; and 6) parameter-free comparability for cross-dataset benchmarking. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to examine metric behavior under genuine, random, and oracle detection scenarios. By comparing their resulting score distributions, we quantify each metric's discriminative ability -- its capability to distinguish meaningful detections from random noise. The results show that while most event-level metrics exhibit strong separability, several widely used metrics (e.g., NAB, Point-Adjust) demonstrate limited resistance to random-score inflation. These findings reveal that metric suitability must be inherently task-dependent and aligned with the operational objectives of IoT applications.
